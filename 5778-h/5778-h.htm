      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Well, wife," said Mr. Benjamin Stanton, as he sat down to a late
      breakfast, "I had a letter from Ohio yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Ohio? Who should write you from Ohio? Anyone I know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sister, Margaret, you remember, moved out there with her husband ten
      years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's from her, is it?" said Mrs. Stanton, indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said her husband with momentary gravity. "It's from a Dr. Kent, who
      attended her in her last illness. Margaret is dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me!" returned Mrs. Stanton, uncomfortably; "and I am just out of
      mourning for my aunt. Do you think it will be necessary for us to go into
      mourning for your sister?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I think not," said her husband. "Margaret has lived away from us so
      long, and people won't know that we have had a death in the family unless
      we mention it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was that all the letter said&mdash;about the death, I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no," said Mr. Stanton, with a little frown. "It seems Margaret left
      a child&mdash;a boy of fourteen; and, as she left no property, the doctor
      suggests that I should send for the boy and assume the care of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word!" said Mrs. Stanton; "you will find yourself in business if
      you undertake to provide for all the beggars' brats that apply to you for
      assistance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must remember that you are speaking of my sister's child," said Mr.
      Stanton, who, cold and selfish and worldly as he was, had some touch of
      decency about him, and did not relish the term "beggars' brats," as
      applied to one so nearly related to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, call him what you like," said his wife; "only don't be so foolish
      as to go spending your money on him when our children need all we have.
      There's Maria needs a new dress immediately. She says all the girls at
      Signor Madalini's dancing academy dress elegantly, and she's positively
      ashamed to appear in any of her present dresses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much will it cost?" asked Mr. Stanton, opening his pocketbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may hand me seventy-five dollars. I think I can make that do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word of remonstrance, the money was placed in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want some money, too," said Tom Stanton, who had just disposed of a
      very hearty meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want it for, Tom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, some of the fellows are getting up a club. It's going to be a select
      affair, and of course each of us has got to contribute some money. You
      see, we are going to hire a room, furnish it nicely with a carpet, black
      walnut furniture, and so on, and that'll cost something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whose idea is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Sam Paget was the first boy that mentioned it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whose son is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His father belongs to the firm of Paget, Norwood &amp; Co. He's awful
      rich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is one of our first families," said Mr. Stanton, with
      satisfaction. "Is he a friend of yours, Tom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, we are quit intimate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right!" said his father, approvingly. "I am glad you choose your
      friends so well. That's one of the principal reasons I have for sending
      you to an expensive school, to get you well launched into good society."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, father, I understand," said Tom. "You won't find me associating with
      common boys. I hold my head a little too high for that, I can tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right, my boy," said Mr. Stanton, with satisfaction. "And now how
      much money do you want for this club of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Tom, hesitatingly, "thirty or forty dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that considerable?" said his father, surprised at the amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see, father, I want to contribute as much as any of the boys.
      It would seem mean if I didn't. There's only a few of us to stand the
      expense, and we don't want to let in any out of our own set."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true," said Mr. Stanton; "I approve of that. It's all very well to
      talk about democracy, but I believe in those of the higher orders keeping
      by themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you'll give the money, father?" said Tom, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Tom, there's forty dollars. It's more than I ought to spare, but I
      am determined you shall stand as good a chance as any of your
      school-fellows. They shan't be able to say that your father stints you in
      anything that your position requires."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, father," said Tom, pocketing the two twenty-dollar bills with
      great satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was that Tom's assessment amounted to only twenty dollars, but he
      thought it would be a good excuse for getting more out of his father. As
      to the extra money, Tom felt confident that he could find uses enough for
      it. He had latterly, though but fourteen years of age, contracted the
      habit of smoking cigars; a habit which he found rather expensive,
      especially as he felt bound occasionally to treat his companions. Then he
      liked, now and then, to drop in and get an ice-cream or some
      confectionery, and these little expenses counted up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanton was a vain, worldly man. He was anxious to obtain an entrance
      into the best society. For this reason, he made it a point to send his
      children to the most expensive schools; trusting to their forming
      fashionable acquaintances, through whom his whole family might obtain
      recognition into those select circles for which he cherished a most
      undemocratic respect. For this reason it was that, though not naturally
      liberal, he had opened his purse willingly at the demands of Mrs. Stanton
      and Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mrs. Stanton, after Tom's little financial affair had been
      adjusted, "what are you going to write to this doctor? Of course you won't
      think of sending for your nephew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By no means. He is much better off where he is. I shall write Dr. Kent
      that he is old enough to earn his own living, and I shall recommend that
      he be bound out to some farmer or mechanic in the neighborhood. It is an
      imposition to expect, because I am tolerably well off, that it is my duty
      to support other people's children. My own are entitled to all I can do
      for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so, father," said Tom, who was ready enough to give his consent to
      any proposition of a selfish nature. "Charity begins at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      With Tom, by the way, it not only began at home, but it ended there, and
      the same may be said of his father. From time to time Mr. Stanton's name
      was found in the list of donors to some charitable object, provided his
      benevolence was likely to obtain sufficient publicity, Mr. Stanton did not
      believe in giving in secret. What was the use of giving away money unless
      you could get credit for it? That was the principle upon which he always
      acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose," continued Tom, "this country cousin of mine wears cowhide
      boots and overalls, and has got rough, red hands like a common laborer. I
      wonder what Sam Paget would say if I should introduce such a fellow to him
      as my cousin. I rather guess he would not want to be quite so intimate
      with me as he is now."
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything had been needed, this consideration would have been sufficient
      to deter Mr. Stanton from sending for his nephew. He could not permit the
      social standing of his family to be compromised by the presence of a poor
      relation from the country, rough and unpolished as he doubtless was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria, too, who had been for some time silent, here contributed to
      strengthen the effect of Tom's words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said she, "and Laura Brooks, my most intimate friend, who is
      shocked at anything vulgar or countrified&mdash;I wouldn't have her know
      that I have such a cousin&mdash;oh, not for the world!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be no occasion for it," said her father, decidedly. "I shall
      write at once to this Dr. Kent, explaining to him my views and wishes, and
      how impossible it is for me to do as he so inconsiderately suggests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the wisest thing you can do, Mr. Stanton," said his wife, who was to
      the full as selfish as her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is his name, father?" asked Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whose name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The boy's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert Mason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert? I thought it might be Jonathan, or Zeke, or some such name.
      Herbert isn't at all countrified."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Tom, slyly; "of course not. We all know why you like that
      name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you're mighty wise, Mr. Tom!" retorted his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's because you like Herbert Dartmouth; but it isn't any use. He's in
      love with Lizzie Graves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to know all about it," said Maria, with vexation; for Tom was
      not far from right in speaking of her preference for Herbert Dartmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I do," said Tom; "I ought to, for he told me so himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe it!" said Maria, who looked ready to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you needn't; but it's so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be quiet, children," said Mrs. Stanton. "Thomas, you mustn't plague your
      sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't take it so hard, Maria," said Tom, in rather an aggravating tone.
      "There's other boys you could get. I guess you could get Jim Gorham for a
      beau, if you tried hard enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't have him," said Maria. "His face is all over freckles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough of this quarreling, children," said Mrs. Stanton. "I hope," she
      continued, addressing her husband, "you won't fail to write at once. They
      might be sending on the boy, and then we should be in a pretty
      predicament."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will write at once. I don't know but I ought to inclose some money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see why you need to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I had better, as this is the last I intend to do for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate, it won't be necessary to send much," said Mrs. Stanton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five dollars will do, I should think. Because he happens to be your
      nephew, there is no good reason why he should be thrown upon you for
      support."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it will be best to send ten dollars," said Mr. Stanton. "People
      are unreasonable, you know, and they might charge me with meanness, if I
      sent less."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then make it ten. It's only for once. I hope that will be the last we
      shall hear of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The room in which this conversation took place was a handsomely furnished
      breakfast room, all the appointments of which spoke not only of comfort,
      but of luxury. Mr. Stanton had been made rich by a series of lucky
      speculations, and he was at present carrying on a large wholesale store
      downtown. He had commenced with small means twenty years before, and for
      some years had advanced slowly, until the tide of fortune set in and made
      him rich. His present handsome residence he had only occupied three years,
      having moved to it from one of much smaller pretensions on Bleecker
      Street. Tom and Maria were forbidden to speak of their former home to
      their present fashionable acquaintances, and this prohibition they were
      likely to observe, having inherited to the full the worldly spirit which
      actuated their parents. It will be seen that Herbert Mason was little
      likely to be benefited by having such prosperous relations.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      INTRODUCING THE HERO
    </h3>
    <p>
      If my young readers do not find the town of Waverley on the map of Ohio,
      they may conclude that it was too small to attract the notice of the
      map-makers. The village is small, consisting of about a dozen houses, a
      church, a schoolhouse, and, as a matter of course, one of that well-known
      class of stores in which everything required for the family is sold, from
      a dress-pattern to a pound of sugar. Outside of the village there are
      farmhouses, surrounded by broad acres, which keep them at respectable
      distances from each other, like the feudal castles of the Middle Ages. The
      land is good, and the farmers are thrifty and well-to-do; but probably the
      whole town contains less than a thousand inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the houses, near the church, lived Dr. Kent, whose letter has
      already been referred to. He was a skillful physician, and a very worthy
      man, who would have been very glad to be benevolent if his limited
      practice had supplied him with the requisite means. But chance had
      directed him to a healthy and sparsely-settled neighborhood, where he was
      able only to earn a respectable livelihood, and indeed found himself
      compelled to economize at times where he would have liked to indulge
      himself in expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Mason died it was found that the sale of her furniture barely
      realized enough to defray the expenses of her funeral. Herbert, her only
      son, was left wholly unprovided for. Dr. Kent, knowing that he had a rich
      uncle in New York, undertook to communicate to him the position in which
      his nephew had been left, never doubting that he would cheerfully extend a
      helping hand to him. Meanwhile he invited Herbert to come to his house and
      make it his home till his uncle should send for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was a handsome, well-grown boy of fourteen, and a general favorite
      in the village. While his mother lived he had done all he could to lighten
      her tasks, and he grieved deeply for her loss now that she was gone. His
      father had ten years before failed in business in the city of New York,
      and, in a fit of depression, had emigrated to this obscure country
      village, where he had invested the few hundred dollars remaining to him in
      a farm, from which he was able to draw a scanty income. Being a man of
      liberal education, he had personally superintended the education of his
      son till his death, two years before, so that Herbert's attainments were
      considerably in advance of those of other boys of his age in the
      neighborhood. He knew something of Latin and French, which made him looked
      upon as quite a model of learning by his playmates. After his father's
      death he had continued the daily study of the languages, so that he was
      able to read ordinary French with nearly as much ease as if it were
      English. Though studious, he was not a bookworm, but was distinguished in
      athletic sports popular with boys of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough has been said of our hero by way of introduction. Herbert's faults
      and virtues will appear as the record of his adventures is continued. It
      may be hinted only that, while he was frank, manly, and generous in his
      disposition, he was proud and high-spirited also, and perhaps these
      qualities were sometimes carried to excess. He would not allow himself to
      be imposed upon if he could help it. Being strong for his age, he was
      always able to maintain his rights, but never abused his strength by
      making it the instrument of tyrannizing over weaker boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Herbert felt somewhat anxious as to his future prospects. He
      knew that the doctor had written to his Uncle Benjamin about him, and he
      hoped that he might be sent for to New York, having a great curiosity to
      see the city, of which he had heard so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you heard from my uncle, Dr. Kent?" he inquired, a few days after
      the scene recorded in our first chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      His question was prompted by seeing the doctor coming into the yard with
      an open letter in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Dr. Kent, with troubled expression and perplexed took.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does Uncle Benjamin say?" asked our young hero, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing very encouraging, Herbert, I am sorry to say," returned the
      doctor. "However, here is the letter; you may read it for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert received the letter from the doctor's hands and read it through
      with feelings of mortification and anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it is:
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR SIR: I have to acknowledge yours of the 10th inst. I regret to hear
      of my sister's decease. I regret, also, to hear that her son, Herbert, is
      left without a provision for his support. My brother-in-law I cannot but
      consider culpable in neglecting to lay up something during his life upon
      which his widow and son might depend. I suspect that he must have lived
      with inconsiderate extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for myself, I have a family of my own to provide for, and the expense
      of living in a city like this is very great. In justice to them, I do not
      feel that it would be right for me to incur extra expense. You tell me
      that he is now fourteen and a stout boy. He is able, I should think, to
      earn his own living. I should recommend that he be bound out to a farmer
      or mechanic. To defray any little expenses that may arise, I enclose ten
      dollars, which I hope he may find serviceable. Yours etc.,
    </p>
    <h3>
      "BENJAMIN STANTON."
    </h3>
    <p>
      This cold and selfish letter Herbert read with rising color, and a feeling
      of bitterness found a place in his young heart, which was quite foreign to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Herbert, what do you think of it?" asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," said Herbert, hotly, "that I don't want to have anything to do
      with an uncle who could write such a letter as that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He doesn't seem to write with much feeling." acknowledged the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feeling!" repeated Herbert; "he writes as if I were a beggar, and asked
      charity. Where is the money he inclosed, Dr. Kent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have it here in my vest pocket. I was afraid it would slip out of the
      letter, and so took care of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you let me send it back to my uncle?" asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send it back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Dr. Kent; I don't want any of his charity, and I'll tell him so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid, Herbert, that you are giving way to your pride."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't it a proper pride, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know what to say, Herbert. You must remember, however, that, as
      you are left quite unprovided for, even this small sum may be of use to
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't the smallness of the sum that I mind," said Herbert. "If Uncle
      Benjamin had written a kind letter, or showed the least feeling in it for
      me, or for&mdash;for mother [his voice faltered a moment], I would have
      accepted it thankfully. But I couldn't accept money thrown at me in that
      way. He didn't want to give it to me, I am sure, and wouldn't if he hadn't
      felt obliged to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Kent paced the room thoughtfully. He respected Herbert's feelings, but
      he saw that it was not wise for him to indulge them. He was in a dependent
      situation, and it was to be feared that he would have much to suffer in
      time to come from the coldness and selfishness of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you what to do, Herbert," he said, after a while. "You can
      accept this money as a loan, and repay it when you are able."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With interest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, with interest, if you prefer it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be willing to accept it on those terms," said Herbert; "but I
      want my uncle to understand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may write to your uncle to that effect, if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, Dr. Kent. Then I will write to him at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find some paper in my desk, Herbert. I suppose you will not
      object to my seeing your letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, doctor, I intended to show it to you. You won't expect me to show
      much gratitude, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't insist upon it, Herbert," said the doctor, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert in about half an hour submitted the following note to the doctor's
      inspection. It had cost him considerable thought to determine how to
      express himself, but he succeeded at last to his tolerable satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "UNCLE BENJAMIN [so the letter commenced]: Dr. Kent has just shown me your
      reply to his letter about me. You seem to think I wish you to support me,
      which is not the case. All I should have asked was your influence to help
      me in obtaining a situation in the city, where I might support myself. I
      am willing to work, and shall probably find some opportunity here. The ten
      dollars, which you inclose, I will accept AS A LOAN, and will repay you as
      soon as I am able, WITH INTEREST. HERBERT MASON."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will that do?" asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Kent smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were careful not to express any gratitude, Herbert," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I don't feel any," returned Herbert, promptly. "I feel grateful
      to you, Dr. Kent, for your great kindness. I wish I could pay you for
      that. I shall never forget how you attended my mother in her sickness,
      when there was small prospect of your being paid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy," said the doctor, resting his hand affectionately on
      Herbert's shoulder, "I have been able to do but very little. I wish I
      could do more. If you wish to repay me, you can do it a hundred times over
      by growing up a good and honorable man; one upon whom your mother in
      heaven can look down with grateful joy, if it is permitted her to watch
      your progress here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do my best, doctor," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The world is all before you," proceeded Dr. Kent. "You may not achieve a
      brilliant destiny. It is permitted to few to do that. But whether your
      sphere is wide or narrow, you may exert an influence for good, AND LEAVE
      THE WORLD BETTER FOR YOUR HAVING LIVED IN IT."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it may be so," said Herbert, thoughtfully. "When I am tempted to
      do wrong, I will think of my mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the very best thing you can do, Herbert. And now for your plans. I
      wish I were in a situation to have you remain with me. But as that cannot
      be, I will do my best to get you a place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to be at work," said Herbert, "as I have my living to get. I want
      you to take that ten dollars, doctor, as part payment of the debt I owe
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't do that, Herbert, not even to oblige you. You were too proud to
      accept a favor from your uncle. You will not be too proud, I hope, to
      accept one from me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, doctor; I am not too proud for that. You are my friend, and my uncle
      cares nothing for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Herbert's letter reached New York, his uncle felt a momentary shame,
      for he saw that his nephew had rightfully interpreted his own selfishness
      and lack of feeling, and he could not help involuntarily admiring the
      independent spirit which would not allow him to accept the proffered
      money, except as a loan. But mingled with his shame was a feeling of
      relief, as he foresaw that Herbert's pride would not suffer him to become
      a burden upon him in the future. He hardly expected ever to see the ten
      dollars returned with interest; but even if he lost it, he felt that he
      should be getting off cheap.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A COLLISION
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was a week later when an incident befell Herbert which is worthy of
      mention, since it brought him into collision with a man who was destined
      to have some influence over his future life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A neighboring farmer, for whom, during his mother's life, he had
      occasionally gone on errands, drove up in front of the doctor's house, and
      asked Herbert if he could take his horse and wagon and drive over to the
      mill village to get some corn ground. Herbert was rather glad to accept
      this proposal, not only because he was to receive twenty-five cents for so
      doing, but also because he was fond of driving a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was only about a mile from the mill village, when he saw approaching
      him a man in a light open buggy. Herbert knew every horse in Waverley, and
      every man, woman, and child, for that matter, and he perceived at once
      that the driver was a stranger. To tell the truth, he was not very
      favorably impressed by his appearance. The man was very dark, with black
      hair and an unshaven beard of three days' growth, which did not set off
      his irregular and repulsive features. His mouth, partly open, revealed
      several yellow tusks, stained with tobacco juice. On his head he wore a
      broad-brimmed straw hat, rather the worse for wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that just at this point the middle of the road was much
      better than the sides, which sloped considerably, terminating in gullies
      which were partly full from the recent rains. The road was narrow, being
      wide enough for two vehicles to pass each other, if each veered to the
      side, but not otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert observed that the buggy, which was now rapidly approaching, was
      kept in the center of the road, and that the driver appeared to have no
      intention of turning out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he mean?" thought our hero. "He cannot expect me to do the
      whole of the turning out. I will turn out my half, and if he wants to get
      by, he must do the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, he turned partially to one side, as much as could be
      reasonably expected, and quietly awaited the approach of the man in the
      buggy. The latter still kept the center of the road, and did not turn out
      his carriage at all. As soon as it was close at hand, the driver leaned
      forward and exclaimed angrily:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turn out, boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      If he expected that Herbert would be intimidated by his tone he was much
      mistaken. Our hero was bold, and not easily frightened. He looked quietly
      in the man's face, and said composedly, "I have turned out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then turn out more, you young vagabond! Do you hear me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, I hear you, and should if you didn't speak half so loud."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curse your impudence! I tell you, turn out more!" exclaimed the stranger,
      becoming more and more angry. He had expected to get his own way without
      trouble. If Herbert had been a man, he would not have been so
      unreasonable; but he supposed he could browbeat a boy into doing whatever
      he chose to dictate. But he had met his match, as it turned out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already given you half the road," said Herbert, firmly, "and I
      don't intend to give you any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't, eh? Young man, how old are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am fourteen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think you were forty by the airs you put on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it putting on airs to insist on my rights?" asked our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your rights!" retorted the other, laughing contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my rights," returned Herbert, quietly. "I have a right to half of
      the road, and I have taken it. If I turn out any more, I shall go into the
      gully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That makes no difference. A wetting won't do you any harm. Your impudence
      needs cooling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be," said Herbert, who did not choose to get angry, but was
      resolved to maintain his rights; "but I object to the wetting, for all
      that, and as this wagon is not mine, I do not choose to upset it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the most insolent young scamp I ever came across!" exclaimed the
      other, furiously. "I've a good mind to give you something much worse than
      a wetting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such as what?" asked our hero, coolly. In reply the man flourished his
      whip significantly. "Do you see that?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very well," said the other, ironically; "I'm glad you do. Perhaps you
      wouldn't like to feel it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't think I should," said Herbert, not exhibiting the least
      apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger handled his whip, eyeing our hero viciously at the same time,
      as if it would have afforded him uncommon pleasure to lay it over his
      back. But there was something in the look of our hero which unconsciously
      cowed him, and, much as he wished to strike him, he held back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you're a cool hand," he said, after a moment's hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this our hero did not see fit to make any reply. But he grasped his own
      whip a little tighter. So brutal had been the tone assumed by the
      stranger, that he was not sure but he might proceed to carry out his
      threat, and lay the whip over his back. He determined, in that case, to
      give him as good as he sent. I will not express any opinion as to the
      propriety of this determination, but I am certain, from what I know of our
      hero's fearless spirit, that he would not have hesitated to do it, be the
      consequences what they might. But he did not have the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once more," demanded the stranger, furiously; "are you going to turn
      out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the boy, decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then&mdash;I'll run you down."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he brought the whip violently on the horse's back. The latter
      gave a convulsive spring forward. But his driver had not taken into
      consideration that the farm-wagon was the stronger of the two vehicles,
      and that in any collision the buggy must come off second best. So it
      happened that a wheel of the buggy was broken, and the driver, in the
      shock, thrown sprawling into a puddle on the other side of the road. The
      wagon suffered no damage, but the old horse, terrified, set off at a rapid
      pace. Herbert looked back to see if the stranger was injured, but seeing
      that he had already picked himself up unwounded, but decidedly dirty, he
      concluded to keep on his way to the mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver of the overturned vehicle was considerably more angry than hurt
      at this catastrophe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chafed his pride not a little to think that, after all his vaunts, the
      boy had maintained his ground, and got the better of him. For a man of
      forty-five to be worsted by a boy of fourteen was, it must be confessed, a
      little mortifying. It was something like a great ship of the line being
      compelled to surrender to a little monitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one feels particularly dignified or good-natured when he is picking
      himself out of a mud puddle. Our black-haired acquaintance proved no
      exception to this remark. He shook his fist at the receding wagon and its
      occupant&mdash;a demonstration of defiance which our hero did not witness,
      his back being now turned to his late opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Abner Holden&mdash;for this was the stranger's name&mdash;next turned
      his attention to the buggy, which had been damaged to some extent, and so
      was likely to involve him in expense. This was another uncomfortable
      reflection. Meanwhile, as it was no longer in a fit state for travel, he
      must contrive some way to have it carried back to the stable, and, unless
      he could procure another vehicle, perform the rest of the journey on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, some men in a neighboring field had witnessed the collision, and,
      supposing their services might be required, were now present to lend their
      aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty bad accident," remarked one of them. "That 'ere wheel'll need
      considerable tinkering afore it's fit for use. How came you to get it
      broke so, squire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little rascal had the impudence to dispute the road with me, and would
      not turn out at my bidding," said Mr. Holden, in a tone of exasperation,
      which showed that his temper had been considerably soured by the accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wouldn't turn out? Seems to me from the marks of the wheels, you must
      have been drivin' along in the middle of the road. I guess you didn't take
      the trouble to turn out, yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there was room enough for the boy to turn out one side," said
      Holden, doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are slightly mistaken, stranger," said the other, who was disgusted
      at the traveler's unreasonableness. "There wasn't room; as anyone can see
      that's got eyes in his head. Didn't the youngster turn out at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," snapped Holden, not relishing the other's free speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it seems you were the one that would not turn out. If you had been a
      leetle more accommodating, this accident couldn't have happened. Fair
      play's my motto. If a feller meets you halfway, it's all you have a right
      to expect. I reckon it'll cost you a matter of ten dollars to get that
      'ere buggy fixed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Holden looked savagely at the broken wheel, but that didn't mend matters.
      He would have answered the countryman angrily, but, as he stood in need of
      assistance, this was not good policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you advise me to do about it?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will have to leave the buggy where it is just now. Where did you get
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over at the mill village."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you'd better lead the horse back&mdash;'tain't more'n a mile or so&mdash;get
      another wagon, and tell 'em to send for this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps that is the best way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where was you goin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over to Waverley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's where the boy came from."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The boy that upset you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is his name?" asked Abner Holden, scowling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His name is Herbert Mason, son of the Widder Mason that died two or three
      weeks since. Poor boy, he's left alone in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's he stopping?" asked Holden, hardly knowing why he asked the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Kent took him in after the funeral, so I heard; but the selectmen of
      Waverley are trying to find him a place somewheres, where he can earn his
      own livin'. He's a smart, capable boy, and I guess he can do 'most a man's
      work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden looked thoughtful. Some plan had suggested itself to him
      which appeared to yield him satisfaction, for he began to look decidedly
      more comfortable, and he muttered to himself: "I'll be even with him YET.
      See if I don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How far am I from Waverley?" he asked, after a slight pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, risin' three miles," drawled the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could get somebody to go back with this horse, I don't know but what
      I'd walk to Waverley. Are you very busy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know but I could leave off for a short time," said the
      other, cautiously. "Work's pretty drivin', to be sure. What do you
      cal'late to pay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much would it be worth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's the walk there and back, and then again there's the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can mount the horse going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess fifty cents'll about pay me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Holden took out his pocketbook and paid the required sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way," he said, as if incidentally, "who is the chairman of the
      selectmen in the village of Waverley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ain't thinkin' of takin' that boy, be you?" said the other,
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've had enough to do with him; I don't want ever to lay eyes on him
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I dunno as I should, if I was you," said the countryman, rather
      slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't answered my question yet," said Holden, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, about the cheerman of the selectmen. It's Captain Joseph Ross."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where does he live?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A leetle this side of the village. You'll know the house, well enough.
      It's a large, square house painted white, with a well-sweep in front."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word of thanks for the information, Abner Holden turned, and
      began to walk toward Waverley. Perhaps his object in making these
      inquiries has been guessed. It happened that he needed a boy, and, for
      more reasons than one, he thought he should like to have Herbert bound to
      him. Herbert, as he had noticed, was a stout boy, and he probably could
      get a good deal of work out of him. Then, again, it would be gratifying to
      him to have our hero in subjection to him. He could pay him off then, ten
      times over, for his insolence, as he chose to term it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll break his proud spirit," thought Abner Holden. "He'll find he's got
      a master, if I get hold of him. He don't know me yet, but he will some
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Holden resolved to wait on Captain Ross at once, and conclude
      arrangements with him to take Herbert before our hero had returned from
      the mill village. He pictured, with a grim smile, Herbert's dismay when he
      learned who was to be his future master.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the help of a handkerchief dipped into a crystal stream at the
      roadside, Abner Holden succeeded in effacing some of the muddy stains upon
      his coat and pantaloons, and at length got himself into presentable trim
      for calling upon a "selectman."
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he came in sight of the house which had been described to him as
      that of Captain Ross. There was a woman at the well-sweep engaged in
      drawing water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does Captain Ross live here?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he at home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's over in the three-acre lot. Was you wantin' to see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to. Is the field far away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it's just behind the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I guess I'll go and find him. I want to see him on a little matter
      of business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Holden crossed a mowing-field, and then, climbing over a stone wall,
      found himself at the edge of the three-acre lot. The captain was
      superintending one or two hired men, and, as he had his coat off, had
      probably been assisting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Ross?" said Abner Holden, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are chairman of the selectmen, I believe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand that you have a boy that you want to bind out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon you mean Herbert Mason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I believe that's the name I heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you in want of a boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am looking out for one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I keep a store, but I should want him to work on land part of the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you live hereabouts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over at Cranston."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you'll come to the house, we'll talk the matter over. The boy's a good
      boy, and we want to get a good place for him. His mother was a widder, and
      he's her only son. He's a smart, capable lad, and good to work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've no doubt he'll suit me. I'll take him on your recommendation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We should want him to go to school winters. He's a pretty good scholar
      already. His father was a larned man, and used to teach him before he
      died. If he had lived, I reckon Herbert would certainly have gone to
      college."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll agree to send him to school in the winter for the next two years,"
      said Holden, "and will give him board and clothes, and when he's
      twenty-one a freedom suit, and a hundred dollars. Will that do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know but that's reasonable," said Captain Ross, slowly. "The
      boy's a bit high-spirited, but if you manage him right, I guess you'll
      like him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll manage him!" thought Abner Holden. "Can I take him with me
      to-morrow?" he asked. "I don't come this way very often."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I guess that can be arranged. We'll go over to Dr. Kent's after
      dinner, and see if they can get him ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the meantime," said Holden, afraid that the prize might slip through
      his fingers, "suppose we make out the papers. I suppose you have full
      authority in the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Ross had no objection, and thus poor Herbert was unconsciously
      delivered over to the tender mercies of a man who had very little love for
      him.

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A DISAGREEABLE SURPRISE
    </h3>
    <p>
      After his collision with the traveler, Herbert hurried on to the mill,
      intent upon making up for lost time. He was satisfied with having
      successfully maintained his rights; and, as he had no reason to suppose he
      should ever again see his unreasonable opponent, dismissed him from his
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the mill, he found he should have to remain an hour or two
      before he could have his grain ground. He was not sorry for this, as it
      would give him an opportunity to walk around the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish," he thought, "I could get a place in one of the stores here.
      There's more going on than there is in Waverley, and I could go over
      Sundays to see Dr. Kent's family."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the spur of the moment, he resolved to inquire if some of the
      storekeepers did not require help. There was a large dry-goods store&mdash;the
      largest in the village&mdash;kept by Beckford &amp; Keyes. He entered and
      inquired for the senior partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Beckford is not in," said the clerk. "Mr. Keyes is standing at that
      desk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert went up to the desk, and said inquiringly, "Mr. Keyes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my name," said that gentleman, pleasantly. "Is there anything I
      can do for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am in search of a place," said our hero, "and I thought you might have
      a vacancy here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have none just at present," said Mr. Keyes, who was favorably
      impressed by Herbert's appearance; "but it is possible we may have in a
      few weeks. Where do you live? Not in the village, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said Herbert, and a shadow passed over his face, "My mother
      died three weeks since, and I am now stopping at the house of Dr. Kent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Kent&mdash;ah, yes, I know the doctor. He is an excellent man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is," said Herbert, warmly. "He has been very kind to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert Mason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Herbert, I will promise to bear you in mind. I will note down your
      name and address, and as soon as we have a vacancy I will write to you.
      Come into the store whenever you come this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the store feeling quite encouraged. Even if the chance never
      amounted to anything, the kind words and manner of the storekeeper gave
      him courage to hope that he would meet with equal kindness from others.
      Kind words cost nothing, but they have a marvelous power in lightening the
      burdens of the sorrowful and cheering the desponding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert left the store, feeling that he should consider himself truly
      fortunate if he could obtain a place in such an establishment. But there
      was a rough experience before him, of which at present he guessed nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After sauntering about the village a little longer, and buying a stick of
      candy for little Mary Kent, the doctor's only daughter, who was quite
      attached to Herbert, our hero got back to the mill in time to receive his
      bags of meal, with which he was soon on his way homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the place where he met Mr. Holden he was hailed by a man at work in
      the field&mdash;the same who had taken back that gentleman's horse to the
      stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, boy, you had a kind of scrimmage, didn't you, coming over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see it?" asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the other, grinning. "I seed the other feller in the mud
      puddle. He was considerably riled about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was his own fault. I gave him half the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it; but there's some folks that want more than their share."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was his buggy broken? I don't know but I ought to have stopped to help
      him, but he had been so unreasonable that I didn't feel much like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His wheel got broken. I drawed the buggy into the bushes. There 'tis now.
      It'll cost him a matter of ten dollars to fix it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry for that," said Herbert; "but I can't see that I was to blame
      in the matter. If I had turned out as he wanted me to, I should have
      tipped over, and, as the wagon didn't belong to me, I didn't think it
      right to risk it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not. You wasn't called on to give in to such unreasonableness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did the man go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He concluded to walk on to Waverley, and hired me to take the horse back
      to the stable. He wanted to know who you were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe he's goin' to sue you for damages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe he'll get much if he does," laughed our hero. "My
      property is where he can't get hold of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho! ho!" laughed the other, understanding the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this conversation Herbert continued on his way, and, after
      delivering the grain, took his way across the fields to his temporary
      home. He entered by the back yard. Little Mary came running out to meet
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have oo come back, Herbert?" she said. "Where have oo been?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been to buy Mary some candy," he said, lifting her up and kissing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whose horse is that at the gate?" asked Herbert, as the doctor's wife
      entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It belongs to Captain Ross," she said. "He has come on business connected
      with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Connected with me!" repeated Herbert, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear boy, I am afraid we must make up our minds to lose you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he found a place for me?" asked Herbert, in a tone of disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I believe he has bound you out to a man in Cranston."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be sorry to have you go, Herbert, but I thought you wanted to
      go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I do; but by waiting a few weeks I could probably get a place in
      Beckford &amp; Keyes' store, at the mill village."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert detailed his interview of the morning with the junior partner.
      Just at this moment the doctor entered the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you told him?" he inquired, looking at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and he says that but for this he might probably have got a chance to
      go into Beckford's store at the mill village."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry for this. They are good men, and he would have been near us,
      while Cranston is forty miles away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is the man that wants me?" asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Mr. Holden. He is in the other room with Captain Ross. It was all
      arranged before they came. He wants you to go with him to-morrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So soon?" said Herbert, in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. At first he wished you to set off with him this afternoon; but I
      told him decidedly you could not be ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite impossible," said Mrs. Kent. "Some of Herbert's clothes are in the
      wash, and I can't have them ready till evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better come into the other room, Herbert," said the doctor. "I
      will introduce you to your new employer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert followed the doctor into the sitting-room. His first glance rested
      on Captain Ross, whom he knew. He went up and shook hands with him. Next
      he turned to Mr. Holden, and to his inexpressible astonishment, recognized
      his opponent of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Holden, Herbert," introduced the doctor. "Mr. Holden, this is the boy
      we have been speaking of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen Mr. Holden before," said Herbert, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Mr. Holden, writhing his disagreeable features into an
      unpleasant smile. "We have met before."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Kent looked from one to the other in surprise, as if seeking an
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our acquaintance doesn't date very far back," said Mr. Holden. "We met
      this morning between here and the mill village."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," said the doctor; "you passed each other, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no; I can't say we did exactly," said Mr. Holden, with the same
      unpleasant smile, "We tried to, but the road being narrow, there was a
      collision, and I came off second-best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope there was no accident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing to speak of. I got tipped out, and my clothes, as you may
      observe, suffered some. As for my young friend here, he rode on
      uninjured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must excuse my not stopping to inquire if I could help you," said
      Herbert; "but my horse was frightened by the collision, and I could not
      easily stop him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's of no consequence," said Mr. Holden, in an off-hand manner. He
      was determined not to show himself out in his true colors until he had got
      Herbert absolutely under his control.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where is your horse, Mr. Holden?" asked Captain Ross. "I think you
      were walking when you came to my house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sent it back to the village by a man I met on the road, my buggy being
      disabled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your carriage wasn't much injured, I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, not much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see exactly how it could happen," said Captain Ross. "I thought
      the road from here to the mill village was broad enough at any point for
      carriages to pass each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't dream," said Mr. Holden, not noticing this remark, "that the
      young man I had engaged was my young acquaintance of the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked at him, puzzled by his entire change of manner&mdash;a
      change so sudden that he suspected its genuineness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he thought of it, the more unwilling he felt to live with Mr.
      Holden. But could it be avoided? He resolved to try. He accordingly told
      the doctor and Captain Ross of the promise that Mr. Keyes had made him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be a good place," said the captain; "but it ain't certain. Now,
      here's Mr. Holden, ready to take you at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I was in the mill village I could come over and see my friends here
      now and then. Besides, I think I should like being in a store."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I've got a store, too," said Mr. Holden, "and I should expect you to
      tend there part of the time. I don't think I can let you off, my young
      friend," he added, with a disagreeable smile. "I think we shall get along
      very well together."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did not feel at all sure of this, but he saw that it would do no
      good to remonstrate farther, and kept silence. Soon after, Mr. Holden and
      Captain Ross rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll call round for my young friend about nine to-morrow morning," said
      Abner Holden, with an ingratiating smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will endeavor to have him ready," said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they went away Herbert wandered about in not the best of spirits. He
      was convinced that he should not be happy with Mr. Holden, against whom he
      had conceived an aversion, founded partly upon the occurrences of the
      morning, and partly on the disagreeable impression made upon him by Abner
      Holden's personal appearance.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE ENVELOPE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Herbert woke up early the next morning, and a feeling of sadness came over
      him as he reflected that it was his last morning in Waverley. He was going
      out into the world, and, as he could not help thinking, under very
      unfavorable auspices. New scenes and new experiences usually have a charm
      for a boy, but Mr. Holden's disagreeable face and unpleasant smile rose
      before him, and the prospect seemed far from tempting.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came downstairs, he found Mrs. Kent in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are up early, Mrs. Kent," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Herbert; I want you to have a good breakfast before you go."
    </p>
    <p>
      It certainly was a nice breakfast. Tender beefsteak, warm biscuit, golden
      butter, potatoes fried crisp and brown, and excellent coffee, might have
      tempted any appetite. Herbert, in spite of his sadness, did full justice
      to the bountiful meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family had hardly risen from breakfast when the sound of wheels was
      heard outside, and directly there was a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Mr. Holden," said the doctor, looking from the front window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must we part from you so soon, Herbert?" said Mrs. Kent, affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where oo goin', Herbert?" asked little Mary, clinging to his knee,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert's going away, Mary," said he, stooping and kissing his little
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert mustn't go 'way," said the little girl, in discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert come back soon, and bring candy for Mary," he said, wishing that
      his words might come true.
    </p>
    <p>
      By that time Mr. Holden had entered, and was surveying the scene with his
      disagreeable smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little Mary is quite attached to Herbert," said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry," said Mr. Holden, "that I have no little girls, as Herbert
      seems fond of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert doubted if he could become attached to anyone related to Mr.
      Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a bachelor," said Mr. Holden, "though perhaps I ought to be ashamed
      to say so. If I had had the good fortune early in life to encounter a lady
      like your good wife here, it might have been different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't too late yet, Mr. Holden," said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps not. If Mrs. Kent is ever a widow, I may try my luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a disagreeable man," thought the doctor's wife, not propitiated by
      the compliment. "Herbert," she said, "here are a couple of handkerchiefs I
      bought in the village yesterday. I hope you will find them useful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; no doubt he will," said Mr. Holden, laughing. "He will think of you
      whenever he has a bad cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody even smiled at this witty sally, and, Mr. Holden, a little
      disappointed, remarked: "Well, time's getting on. I guess we must be
      going, as we have a long journey before us."
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole family accompanied Herbert to the road. After kissing Mary and
      Mrs. Kent, and shaking the doctor cordially by the hand, Herbert jumped
      into the wagon. Just before the horse started the doctor handed our hero a
      sealed envelope, saying, "You can open it after a while."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though, like most boys of his age, Herbert had a great horror of making a
      baby of himself, he could hardly help crying as he rode up the street, and
      felt that he had parted from his best friends. His eyes filled with tears,
      which he quietly wiped away with the corner of his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, don't blubber, boy," said Mr. Holden, coarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was not weak enough to melt into tears at an unkind word. It
      roused his indignation, and he answered, shortly, "When you see me
      blubbering, it'll be time enough to speak, Mr. Holden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looked a good deal like it, at any rate," said Abner. "However, I'm
      glad if I'm mistaken. There's nothing to cry about that I can see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, perhaps not," said Herbert; "but there's something to be sorry for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something to be sorry for, is there?" said Abner Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've left my best friends, and I don't know when I shall see them again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I," said Mr. Holden. "But I think it's high time you left them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" asked Herbert, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because they were petting you and making too much of you. You won't get
      such treatment as that from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't expect it," said our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's lucky," said Abner Holden, dryly. "It's well that people shouldn't
      expect what they are not likely to get."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a sense of the ludicrous came over Herbert as he thought of being Mr.
      Holden's pet, and he laughed heartily. Not understanding the reason of his
      sudden mirth, that gentleman demanded, in a tone of irritation, "What are
      you making a fool of yourself about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What am I laughing at?" said Herbert, not liking the form of the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," snarled Abner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The idea of being your pet," explained Herbert, frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Holden did not appreciate the joke, and said roughly, "You better shut
      up, if you know what's best for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode along in silence for a few minutes. Then Abner Holden, thinking
      suddenly of the envelope which Dr. Kent had placed in Herbert's hand at
      parting, and feeling curious as to its contents, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did the doctor give you just as you were starting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was an envelope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that; but what was there in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't looked," said our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a little satisfaction in snubbing Mr. Holden, whom he saw he would
      never like.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you open it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't think of it before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose there is some present inside."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert decided to open the envelope, out of respect for Dr. Kent. On
      opening it, he drew out a five-dollar bill, and a few penciled words,
      which were as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR HERBERT: I would gladly give you more if I had the means. I hope you
      will use the inclosed money in any way that may be most serviceable to
      you. You must write to me often. Be a good boy, as you always have been;
      let your aims be noble; try to do right at all hazards, and may God bless
      your efforts, and make you a good and true man. Such is the prayer of your
      affectionate friend, GEORGE KENT."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert read these lines with emotion, and inwardly resolved that he would
      try to carry out the recommendations laid down. His thoughts were broken
      in upon by Mr. Holden, whose sharp eyes detected the bank-note.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's money in the letter, isn't there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five dollars, hey?" he said. "You'd better give it to me to keep for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mr. Holden; I can take care of it, myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't a good plan for boys to have so large a sum of money in their
      possession," said Abner Holden, who was anxious to secure it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because they are likely to spend it improperly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Kent didn't seem to think I was likely to do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he trusted you too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it won't prove so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better keep out of the way of temptation. You might lose it,
      besides."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't often lose things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, boy," said Mr. Holden, getting impatient; "Dr. Kent, no doubt,
      intended that I should take care of the money for you. You'd better give
      it up without further trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't he give it to you, then?" demanded Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He supposed you would give it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Holden's motive for getting the money into his own hands was twofold.
      First, he knew that without money Herbert would be more helpless and more
      in his power. Secondly, as he had agreed to supply Herbert with clothing,
      he thought he might appropriate the money towards this purpose, and it
      would be so much of a saving to his own pocket. Perhaps Herbert suspected
      some such design. At any rate, he had no intention of gratifying Mr.
      Holden by giving up the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, are you going to give me the money?" blustered Abner Holden, taking
      out his pocketbook, ready to receive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll repent this conduct, young man," said Holden, scowling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I shall," said our hero. "I don't understand why you are so
      anxious to get hold of the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is for your good," said Abner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather keep it," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden hardly knew what to do. The money was by this time safely
      stowed away in Herbert's pocket, where he could not very well get at it.
      However, he had a plan for getting it which he resolved to put into
      practice when they stopped for dinner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ON THE WAY
    </h3>
    <p>
      By the time they had ridden twenty miles both Herbert and Mr. Holden felt
      hungry. The fresh air had produced a similar effect upon both. They
      approached a broad, low building with a swinging sign and a long piazza in
      front, which it was easy to see was a country tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you feel hungry, boy?" inquired Abner Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," returned our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I. I think I shall get some dinner here. You can get some, too, if
      you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there's no occasion to thank me," said Mr. Holden, dryly. "I shall
      pay for my dinner, and if you want any, you can pay for yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked surprised. As he had entered Mr. Holden's employ, he
      supposed of course that the latter would feel bound to provide for him,
      and it certainly seemed mean that he should be compelled to pay for his
      own dinner. However, he was beginning to suspect that his new employer was
      essentially a mean man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much will it cost?" asked Herbert, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirty-seven cents," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be remembered that this was in the day of low prices, when gold
      was at par, and board could be obtained at first-class city hotels for two
      dollars and a half a day, and in country villages at that amount by the
      week.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirty-seven cents!" Herbert hardly liked to break in upon his scanty
      hoard, but the morning air had sharpened his appetite, and he felt that he
      must have something to eat. Besides, he remembered one thing which
      fortunately Mr. Holden did not know, that in addition to the five dollars
      which Dr. Kent had given him he had the ten dollars sent him by his uncle,
      and not only that, but a little loose change which he had earned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, are you going to get out?" asked Abner Holden. "It's nothing to me
      whether you take dinner or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I guess I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Holden, who had a reason for being pleased with his
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both went into the tavern. There were two or three loungers on a settle,
      who gazed at them curiously. One of them at once appeared to recognize
      Abner Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dy do, Holden?" he said. "Who've you got with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A boy I've taken," said Holden, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pretty smart-looking boy. Where'd you pick him up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over in Waverley. He's got some pretty high notions, but I guess I'll
      take 'em out of him in time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," chuckled the other; "I warrant you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      While this conversation was going on Herbert had entered the tavern, but
      he could not avoid hearing what was said, including Mr. Holden's reply. He
      was not frightened, but inwardly determined that he would do his duty, and
      then if Mr. Holden saw fit to impose upon him, he would make what
      resistance he was able.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder what high notions he means," thought our hero. "If he expects to
      make a slave of me, he will be mistaken, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down there, and I'll go and order dinner," said Mr. Holden, entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then, however, the landlord came in and greeted Abner Holden, whom he
      appeared to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want dinner for two, Mr. Robinson," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For two! You haven't brought your wife along with you, Holden?" he said,
      jocosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I haven't come across any such lady yet. I've got a boy here who is
      bound to me. And hark you, landlord," he added, in a lower voice, that
      Herbert might not hear, "he will pay you for his dinner out of a
      five-dollar bill which he has with him. YOU NEEDN'T GIVE BACK THE CHANGE
      TO HIM, BUT TO ME."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I understand," said the landlord, winking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I prefer to keep the money for him. He has refused to give it up and this
      will give me a chance to get hold of it without any fuss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he kept it himself he'd spend it in some improper way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so. I'll attend to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now our hero was gifted with pretty sharp ears, and he caught enough of
      this conversation to understand Mr. Holden's plot, which he straightway
      determined should not succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shan't take me in this time, Mr. Holden," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his pocketbook to see if he had enough small change to pay for
      his dinner without intrenching upon his bill. There proved to be a quarter
      and two half-dimes, amounting, of course, to thirty-five cents. This would
      not be quite sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must change the bill somewhere," he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking out of the tavern window, he saw the village store nearly
      opposite. He took his cap and ran over. There was a clerk leaning with his
      elbows upon the counter, appearing unoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Herbert that he might want some paper and envelopes. He
      inquired the price.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We sell the paper at a penny a sheet, and the envelopes will cost you
      eight cents a package."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you may give me twelve sheets of paper and a package of envelopes,"
      said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The package was done up for him and in payment he tendered the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk gave him back four dollars and eighty cents in change. He put
      the money in his pocketbook, and the paper and envelopes in his
      jacket-pocket, and returned to the tavern well pleased with his success.
      Mr. Holden was in the barroom, taking a glass of "bitters," and had not
      noticed the absence of our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was soon ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some beefsteak and coffee and a whole apple pie. Herbert
      surveyed the viands with satisfaction, having a decidedly good appetite.
      He soon found, however, that hungry as he was, he stood a poor chance with
      Abner Holden; that gentleman, being a very rapid eater, managed to
      appropriate two-thirds of the beefsteak and three-quarters of the pie.
      However, the supply being abundant, Herbert succeeded in making a
      satisfactory repast, and did not grudge the amount which he knew he should
      have to pay for it before leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said Abner Holden, his eyes twinkling at the thought of our hero's
      coming discomfiture, "we'll go and settle our bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Herbert, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the public room and advanced to the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This boy wants to pay for his dinner, Mr. Robinson," said Abner,
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much will it be?" asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirty-seven cents."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert took out of his vest pocket a quarter, a dime and two cents, and
      handed them over.
    </p>
    <p>
      To say that Abner Holden looked amazed is not sufficient. He looked
      disgusted and wronged, and glared at Herbert as if to inquire how he could
      have the face to outrage his feelings in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho! ho!" laughed the landlord, who, having no interest in the matter, was
      amused at the course affairs had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert suppressed his desire to laugh, and looked as if he had no
      knowledge of Mr. Holden's plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you get that money?" growled Abner, with a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of my vest pocket," said Herbert, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that, of course, but I thought you had only a bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I got that changed at the store."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dared you go over there without my permission?" roared Abner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't think it necessary to ask your permission to go across the
      street."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you know it now. Don't you go there again without my knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you buy anything at the store?" continued Mr. Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some paper and envelopes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" muttered Abner, discontentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded to pay his own bill and in a few minutes got into the wagon
      and drove off rather sulkily. Herbert saw that Mr. Holden was disturbed by
      the failure of his little plan, and felt amused rather than otherwise. But
      when he reflected that he was going to live with this man, and be, to a
      considerable extent under his control, he felt inclined to be sad. One
      thing he resolved that he would not submit to tyranny. The world was wide,
      and he felt able to earn his own living. He would give Mr. Holden a trial,
      and if he treated him with reasonable fairness he would remain with him.
      But he was not going to be any man's slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile they were getting over the road, and a few more hours brought
      them to their journey's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden's house stood in considerable need of paint. It had no great
      pretensions to architectural beauty, being about as handsome for a house
      as Abner Holden was for a man. There was a dilapidated barn, a little to
      one side, and the yard was littered up with a broken wagon, a woodpile and
      various odds and ends, giving the whole a very untidy look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this where you live, Mr. Holden?" asked Herbert, looking about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and I'm glad to get home. Do you know how to unharness a horse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then jump out and unharness this horse. A man will come for it
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did as directed. Then he took his little trunk from the wagon, and
      went with it to the back door and knocked.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A NEW HOME
    </h3>
    <p>
      The door was opened by an elderly woman, rather stout, who acted as Abner
      Holden's housekeeper. Though decidedly homely, she had a pleasant look,
      which impressed Herbert favorably. He had feared she might turn out
      another edition of Mr. Holden, and with two such persons he felt that it
      would be difficult to get along.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come right in," said Mrs. Bickford, for that was her name. "Let me help
      you with your trunk. You can set it down here for the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be tired," said the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not very," said our hero. "We rode all the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's tiresome riding, at any rate, when it's such a long distance.
      You came from Waverley, Mr. Holden tells me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that is more than thirty miles away, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I believe so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you've come to help Mr. Holden?" she added, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I suppose so," said Herbert, rather seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert Mason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope, Herbert, we shall be able to make you comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Herbert, a little more cheerful, as he perceived that he
      was to have one friend in Mr. Holden's household.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has Mr. Holden generally kept a boy?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he calculates to keep one most of the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was the last one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His name was Frank Miles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was he here long?" asked Herbert, in some curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no," said the housekeeper, "he did not stay very long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was here 'most a month."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Most a month? Didn't he like it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no; he didn't seem to like Mr. Holden much."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was not much surprised to hear this. He would have thought Frank
      Miles a singular sort of a boy if he had liked Abner Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have any of the boys that have been here liked Mr. Holden?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say as they have," said Mrs. Bickford, frankly; "and somehow they
      don't seem to stay long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't they like him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sh!" said the housekeeper, warningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked round and saw his employer entering the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, boy, have you put up the horse?" he asked, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you give him some hay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And some grain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I didn't know where it was kept. If you'll tell me, I'll do it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you needn't. He isn't to have any. He's only a hired horse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering that the hired horse had traveled over thirty miles, Herbert
      thought he was entitled to some oats; but Mr. Holden was a mean man, and
      decided otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Herbert to sleep, Mr. Holden?" asked the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Up garret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a small corner bedroom in the second story," suggested Mrs.
      Bickford, who knew that the garret was not very desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess he won't be too proud to sleep in the garret," said Mr. Holden.
      "Shall you?" he continued, turning to Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put me where you please," said Herbert, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it shall be the garret. You can take your trunk up now. Mrs.
      Bickford will show you the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too heavy for you, Herbert," said the housekeeper; "I will help
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he can carry it alone," said Abner Holden. "He isn't a baby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather help him," said the housekeeper, taking one handle of the
      trunk. "You go first, Herbert, You're young and spry, and can go faster
      than I."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second landing Herbert saw the little bedroom in which the
      housekeeper wanted to put him. It was plainly furnished, but it was light
      and cheerful, and he was sorry he was not to have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could have had that bedroom just as well as not," said Mrs. Bickford.
      "It's never used. But Mr. Holden's rather contrary, and as hard to turn as
      a&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mule?" suggested Herbert, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's pretty much so," said the housekeeper, joining in the laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went up a narrow staircase and emerged into a dark garret, running
      the whole length of the house without a partition. The beams and rafters
      were visible, for the sloping sides were not plastered. Herbert felt that
      he might as well have been in the barn, except that there was a small cot
      bedstead in the center of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't very pleasant," said the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Herbert, "I don't think it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I declare, it's too bad you should have to sleep here. Mr. Holden isn't
      very considerate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess I can stand it," said our hero, "though I should rather be
      downstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll bring up the trap and set it before you go to bed," said Mrs.
      Bickford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The trap!" repeated Herbert, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, there's rats about, and I suppose you'd rather have a trap than a
      cat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; the cat would be about as bad as the rats."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Abner Holden's voice was heard at the bottom of the stairs,
      and Mrs. Bickford hurried down, followed by our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you were going to stay up there all day," said Mr. Holden.
      "What were you about up there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my business," said Mrs. Bickford, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper was independent in her feelings, and, knowing that she
      could readily obtain another situation, did not choose to be browbeaten by
      Mr. Holden. He was quite aware of her value, and the difficulty he would
      experience in supplying her place, and he put some constraint over himself
      in the effort not to be rude to her. With Herbert, however, it was
      different. HE was BOUND to him, and therefore in his power. Abner Holden
      exulted in this knowledge, and with the instinct of a petty tyrant
      determined to let Herbert realize his dependence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may go out and saw some wood," he said. "You'll find the saw in the
      woodshed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What wood shall I saw?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wood in the woodpile, stupid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, sir," said our hero, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert thought Mr. Holden was losing no time in setting him to work.
      However, he had resolved to do his duty, unpleasant as it might be, as
      long as Abner Holden only exacted what was reasonable, and Herbert was
      aware that he had a right to require him to go to work at once. Mrs.
      Bickford, however, said a word in his favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got wood enough to last till to-morrow, Mr. Holden," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's likely the boy is tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's he done to make him tired, I should like to know? Ridden thirty
      miles, and eaten a good dinner!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which I paid for myself," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What if you did?" said Abner Holden, turning to him. "I suppose you'll
      eat supper at my expense, and you'd better do something, first, to earn
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I am willing to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then go out to the woodpile without any more palavering."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Holden," said the housekeeper, seriously, after Herbert had gone out,
      "if you want to keep that boy, I think you had better be careful how you
      treat him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you say that?" demanded Abner, eying her sharply. "Has he been
      saying anything to you about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why did you say that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I can see what kind of a boy he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what kind of a boy is he?" asked Abner, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is high-spirited, and will work faithfully if he's treated well, but
      he won't allow himself to be imposed upon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can read it in his face. I have had some experience with boys, and you
      may depend upon it that I am not mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had better do his duty," blustered Abner, "if he knows what's best for
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will do his duty," said the housekeeper, firmly, "but there is a duty
      which you owe to him, as well as he to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't I always do my duty by boys, Mrs. Bickford?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mr. Holden, I don't think you do. You know very well you can never
      get a boy to stay with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This boy is bound to me, Mrs. Bickford&mdash;legally bound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be; but if you don't treat him as he ought to be treated, he
      will run away, take my word for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he does, he'll be brought back, take my word for that, Mrs. Bickford.
      I shall treat him as I think he deserves, but as to petting and pampering
      the young rascal I shall do nothing of the kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you will," said the housekeeper. "However, I've warned
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to take a good deal of interest in the boy," said Abner,
      sneeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "After half an hour's acquaintance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've known him long enough to see that he's better than the common run of
      boys, and I hope that he'll stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no doubt about that," said Abner Holden, significantly. "He'll
      have to stay, whether he wants to or not."

      THE GHOST IN THE ATTIC
    </h3>
    <p>
      After working two hours at the woodpile, Herbert was called in to tea.
      There was no great variety, Abner Holden not being a bountiful provider.
      But the bread was sweet and good, and the gingerbread fresh. Herbert's two
      hours of labor had given him a hearty appetite, and he made a good meal.
      Mrs. Bickford looked on approvingly. She was glad to see that our hero
      enjoyed his supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was tea on the table, and, after pouring out a cup for Mr. Holden,
      the housekeeper was about to pour out one for Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He don't want any tea," said Abner, noticing the action. "Keep the cup
      for yourself, Mrs. Bickford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, Mr. Holden?" asked the housekeeper, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tea isn't good for a growing boy. A glass of cold water will be best for
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't agree with you, Mr. Holden," said the housekeeper, decidedly.
      "Herbert has been hard at work, and needs his tea as much as you or I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, without waiting for his permission, she handed the cup to
      Herbert, who proceeded to taste it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden frowned, but neither Herbert nor the housekeeper took much
      notice of it. The latter was somewhat surprised at this new freak on the
      part of Abner, as he had never tried to deprive any of Herbert's
      predecessors of tea or coffee. But the fact was, Mr. Holden disliked
      Herbert, and was disposed to act the petty tyrant over him. He had neither
      forgotten nor forgiven the boy's spirited defiance when they first met,
      nor his refusal to surrender into his hands the five dollars which the
      doctor had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling tired by eight o'clock, Herbert went up to his garret room and
      undressed himself. An instinct of caution led him to take out the money in
      his porte-monnaie, and put it in his trunk, which he then locked, and put
      the key under the sheet, so that no one could get hold of it without
      awakening him. This precaution proved to be well taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert lay down upon the bed, but did not immediately go to sleep. He
      could not help thinking of his new home, and the new circumstances in
      which he was placed. He did not feel very well contented, and felt
      convinced from what he had already seen of Mr. Holden, that he should
      never like him. Then thoughts of his mother, and of her constant and
      tender love, and the kind face he would never more see on earth, swept
      over him, and almost unmanned him. To have had her still alive he would
      have been content to live on dry bread and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought, too, of the doctor's family and their kindness. How different
      it would have been if he might have continued to find a home with them!
      But when he was tempted to repine, the thought of his mother's Christian
      instructions came to him, and he was comforted by the reflection, that
      whatever happened to him was with the knowledge of his Father in heaven,
      who would not try him above his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try and trust! That was almost the last advice his mother had given him,
      as the surest way of winning the best success.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he thought, "I will try and trust, and leave the rest with God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mr. Holden had not been able to keep out of his head the five
      dollars which he knew Herbert possessed. He was a mean man, and wished to
      appropriate it to his own use. Besides this, he was a stubborn man, and
      our hero's resistance only made him the more determined to triumph over
      his opposition by fair means or foul. It struck him that it would be a
      good idea to take advantage of our hero's slumber, and take the money
      quietly from his pocketbook while he was unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, about eleven o'clock, he went softly up the attic stairs with
      a candle in his hand, and, with noiseless steps, approached the bed.
      Herbert's regular breathing assured him that he was asleep. Abner Holden
      took up his pants and felt for his pocketbook. He found it, and drew it
      out with exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha!" he thought; "I've got it."
    </p>
    <p>
      But this brief exultation was succeeded by quick disappointment. The
      pocketbook proved to be quite empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curse it!" muttered Abner, "what has the boy done with his money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that Herbert, his eyes possibly affected by the
      light, awoke, and he discovered his employer examining his pocketbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first feeling was indignation, but the sight of Abner Holden's
      disappointed face amused him, and he determined not to reveal his
      wakefulness, but to watch, him quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he's got two pocketbooks," thought Abner. But in this he was
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next he went to Herbert's trunk, and tried it, but found it locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder where he keeps the key," was his next thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He searched Herbert's pockets, but the search was in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plague take the young rascal!" he muttered, loud enough for Herbert to
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert turned in bed, and Abner Holden, fearing that he might wake up,
      and being on the whole, rather ashamed of his errand, and unwilling to be
      caught in it, went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he didn't make much," thought our hero. "It's lucky I thought to
      put the money in my trunk. If he only knew I had fifteen dollars, instead
      of five, he would be all the more anxious to get hold of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you sleep last night, Herbert?" inquired the housekeeper at
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, thank you, Mrs. Bickford."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was resolved not to drop a hint of what had happened, being curious to
      see if Mr. Holden would make any further attempts to obtain his money. As
      his employer might possibly find a key that would unlock the trunk, he
      thought it prudent, during the day, to carry the money about with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hardly knew whether to expect a visit from Abner the next night, but
      formed a little plan for frightening him if such a visit should take
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that he had in his trunk a fish horn which had been given
      him by someone in Waverley. This he took out of the trunk before retiring
      and hid it under his pillow. It was about nine o'clock when he went to
      bed, but by considerable effort he succeeded in keeping awake for an hour
      or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      About eleven o'clock, Abner Holden, before going to bed himself, decided
      to make one more attempt to obtain possession of Herbert's money. He
      reflected that possibly our hero had only put away his money by chance on
      the previous evening, and might have neglected to do so on the present
      occasion. He desired to get possession of it before any part of it was
      spent, as, judging from what he knew of boys, it would not remain long
      unexpended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, therefore, he took his candle, and removing his thick-soled
      shoes, which might betray him by their sound, crept softly up the steep
      and narrow staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Herbert heard him, and moreover was warned of his visit by the light
      of the candle which he carried. He closed his eyes, and awaited his coming
      in silent expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden looked towards the bed. Herbert's eyes were closed, and his
      breathing was deep and regular.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's sound asleep," thought Abner, with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set down the candle on a chair beside the bed, and began to examine our
      hero's pocketbook once more. But it proved to be empty as before. In the
      pocketbook, however, he found a key, the key, as he supposed, to Herbert's
      trunk. It was not, however, being only a key which Herbert had picked up
      one day in the street, and kept. He had put it in his pocket with a view
      to mislead his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      That gentleman uttered a low exclamation of satisfaction when his fingers
      closed upon the key, never doubting for a moment that it would open the
      trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the candle in its place, he rose from his recumbent position,
      threw the pants on the bed, and went round on the other side, to try the
      key.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got down on his knees before the trunk, and had inserted the key in the
      lock, or rather had made an ineffectual attempt to do so, when suddenly
      the candle was extinguished, and a horrible blast on the fish horn
      resounded through the garret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Abner Holden was not a very courageous man. In fact, he was inclined
      to superstition. He knew that he was engaged in a dishonorable attempt to
      rob a boy who was placed in his charge, and there is an old proverb that
      says "conscience makes cowards of us all." It must be admitted that it was
      rather calculated to affect the nerves to find one's self suddenly in the
      dark, and at the same time to hear such a fearful noise proceeding from an
      unknown quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden jumped to his feet in dire dismay, and, without stopping to
      reflect on the probable cause of this startling interruption, "struck a
      bee line" for the staircase, and descended quicker, probably, than he had
      ever done before, narrowly escaping tumbling the entire distance, in his
      headlong haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had to stuff the bedclothes into his mouth to keep from bursting
      into a shout of laughter, which would have revealed his agency in
      producing the mysterious noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I heard a frightful noise last night soon after I went to bed,"
      said Mrs. Bickford, at the breakfast table. "Didn't you hear anything, Mr.
      Holden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Abner, "I heard nothing. You were probably dreaming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I was. Didn't you hear anything, Herbert?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sleep pretty sound," said Herbert, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden watched him as he said this, and was evidently more perplexed
      than ever. But that was the last visit he paid to the garret at night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      EXPOSING A FRAUD
    </h3>
    <p>
      It would be hard to tell what Abner Holden's precise occupation was. He
      had thirty or forty acres of land, but only cultivated enough to produce
      supplies of vegetables for his own table, and grain for his horses. He
      kept four cows, and he had, at this time, three horses. He had the Yankee
      propensity for "swapping," and from time to time traded horses, generally
      managing to get the best of the bargain, for he was tolerably sharp and
      not much troubled by conscientious scruples about misstating the merits of
      his horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, about two months before Herbert came into his employ, he had himself
      been overreached, and found himself the possessor of a horse of excellent
      outward appearance, but blind of one eye, and with a very vicious temper.
      He accepted the situation with a bad grace, and determined, as soon as
      possible, to "trade" the horse to another party.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, about a fortnight after Herbert's arrival, a gentlemanly-looking
      stranger knocked at Abner Holden's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The call was answered by the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. Holden at home?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden soon made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Holden." said the stranger "I am in search of a good family horse. I
      am told that you have some animals for sale, and called on you, thinking I
      might get suited through you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've come to the right place," said Abner, glibly. "I've got just the
      animal that will suit you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's in the pasture now. If you don't object to walking a short distance,
      I will show him to you. I feel sure he will suit you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, I will go with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This way, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two walked down a green lane at the back of the house to the entrance
      of the pasture, where the three horses, at present comprising Abner
      Holden's entire stock, were grazing leisurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it happened that, of the three, the blind and vicious horse was much
      the best looking. He held his head erect, had a graceful form, and was
      likely to attract favorable notice at first sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden paused at a little distance, and pointed him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of that horse, Mr. Richmond?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very good-looking animal," said the stranger, with an approving glance;
      "but I must explain that I want such an animal as my wife can drive. It is
      absolutely necessary that he should be good-tempered and gentle. If, with
      this, he is handsome, and of good speed, all the better. Now you know what
      I am in search of. Can you recommend this horse of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Abner, confidently, "he will just suit you. I did calculate to
      keep him for my own use, but I'm rather short of money, and I shall have
      to let him go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say he is gentle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, as gentle as need be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could a woman drive him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no trouble about that," said Abner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he has no serious defect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that seems satisfactory. I like his appearance. He would look well
      in harness. What is your price?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two hundred and fifty dollars, cash down," said Abner. "That's too cheap.
      He's worth a cool hundred more, but I got him cheap, and can afford to
      sell him cheap."
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse had cost Mr. Holden just a hundred and ten dollars, and at this
      price he considered himself decidedly taken in; but this he did not
      particularly care to mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two hundred and fifty dollars!" mused the stranger. "It is a little more
      than I intended to pay. Still, if the animal is what you describe, I don't
      know that I shall object on that score."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better take him," said Abner. "It'll be the best bargain you ever
      made, I'll warrant. You'll pay cash down, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then shall we say it's a bargain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite yet. I'll take till the afternoon to think about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better decide now. The fact is, Mr. Richmond, I ought not to let the
      horse go at that figure, and I may change my mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I shall take your horse, but I have agreed to look at another,
      and must see that first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It belongs to a man named Nichols."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sam Nichols?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't advise you to have anything to do with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a regular sharper. You can't depend on anything he says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for the caution. I will be on my guard. But I promised to take
      a look at his horse before deciding. If I don't come to terms with him,
      and I don't think I shall, I will come round some time this afternoon and
      make a bargain with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Holden thought it was hardly politic to urge him farther. With a
      renewed caution as to dealing with Sam Nichols, he let him go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," thought Abner, after he was gone, "it will be a pretty good thing
      if I get rid of Spitfire"&mdash;he had named him thus&mdash;"for two
      hundred and fifty dollars. He's a bad-tempered brute, and blind into the
      bargain. But I'm not bound to tell Mr. Richmond that, and so spoil my
      trade. I've put a flea in his ear about Nichols, and I guess he will be
      back again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospect of making a good bargain caused Abner to be unusually
      pleasant and good-humored, so much so that Mrs. Bickford regarded him with
      surprise. He voluntarily asked her if she did not wish something at the
      store, volunteering to bring home whatever was needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's come over the man?" thought the housekeeper. "It's too good to
      last."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite correct there. Mr. Holden was naturally crabbed, and fair
      weather with him was the exception rather than the rule. On the present
      occasion it did not last many hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden went to the store, but made other calls on the way, so that
      he was three hours absent, and did not return till twelve o'clock, the
      usual dinner hour in his household.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mr. Richmond, his caller of the morning, had been to see Sam
      Nichols, and inspected the horse he had for sale. He did not altogether
      like its appearance, and, moreover, he was prejudiced against him by what
      he had heard from Abner Holden, and came away without effecting a
      purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I can do better," he reflected, "than to take that horse of
      Holden's. Let me see, it is only half-past ten. I shall have time to go up
      there this morning. I suppose I might as well settle matters at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, eleven o'clock found him again in Abner Holden's yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was out in the yard, engaged in splitting wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. Holden at home?" inquired the stranger, pausing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will he be at home soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, I think so. He only went out to the store. He ought to be home
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I think I will wait. I was here once before this morning. I was
      talking with him about buying one of his horses. If you can spare the
      time, I would like to have you go with me to the pasture, and I will take
      another look at the one I saw this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sir," said Herbert, driving the ax into the block upon which
      he had been splitting, prepared to accompany Mr. Richmond to the pasture.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the bars dividing the pasture from the next field. Spitfire
      was cropping the grass just on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There," said the stranger, pointing him out, "that is the horse I was
      looking at."
    </p>
    <p>
      "THAT ONE!" repeated Herbert, in a tone of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he is a fine-looking animal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye-es," said Herbert, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However, I don't so much care about that, as for his being gentle. I want
      him for a family horse, such as my wife may drive, without fear, while I
      am away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Mr. Holden say he's gentle?" asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. He recommended him highly for that, and told me he had no serious
      defect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure this is the horse?" asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. I am not likely to be mistaken in it. I suppose it is all as
      he says?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was in a perplexing position. He knew that if he told the truth he
      should incur Abner Holden's anger, but his conscience revolted at
      suffering the stranger to be taken in, and thus, perhaps, exposing his
      wife to serious danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid I cannot confirm what Mr. Holden says," he answered,
      reluctantly. "The horse is very ill-tempered, and is blind of one eye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible? Then I have had a narrow escape. You have done me a good
      service, my boy, in telling me the truth, for I am, myself, unused to
      horses, and should have taken the animal on your employer's
      recommendation. Accept this acknowledgment of my indebtedness."
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have placed a five-dollar bill in Herbert's hand, but our hero
      firmly refused to receive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have only done my duty, sir. I cannot accept money for doing that.
      Thank you all the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you are right, my lad. If I ever have a chance to serve you,
      don't hesitate to let me know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There'll be a storm if Mr. Holden hears of this," thought Herbert. "But I
      could not do otherwise."

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE CLOUDS GATHER
    </h3>
    <p>
      At twelve o'clock Abner Holden returned home, still in good humor. As he
      did not anticipate another call from his expected customer until the
      afternoon, he made no inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he won't hear about it," thought Herbert, and as he did not wish
      to have any trouble with Mr. Holden, he hoped it might prove so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner was so elated at the thought of his good bargain in prospect, that
      he could not keep it to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've about sold Spitfire, Mrs. Bickford," he said to the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sold Spitfire! Who wants to buy him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man that called here this morning. What do you think he wants him for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To break his neck," suggested the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wants him for a good family horse for his wife to drive," and Abner
      Holden burst into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he's anxious to become a widower," said Mrs. Bickford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; the fact is he thinks the horse is gentle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told him so, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knowing it to be false?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut up, Mrs. Bickford. You know all is fair in trade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't, Mr. Holden. To my mind, a lie's just as much a lie in trade
      as in anything else. I suppose the man trusted to your recommendation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose he did. I got cheated on the horse, and I've got to get rid of
      it, somehow. As it is, I shall make a handsome profit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Mr. Holden, all I've got to say is, I am glad I haven't got as
      tough a conscience as you have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know anything about business, Mrs. Bickford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, manage things your own way. I ain't responsible, but I pity the
      poor man if he buys Spitfire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I," chuckled Abner. "That's where you and I agree, Mrs. Bickford."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert listened in silence. He was disgusted with the utter disregard of
      fair dealing exhibited by Abner Holden, though he was not surprised at it.
      He felt glad that he had been the means of saving Mr. Richmond from being
      overreached, though he know very well that Mr. Holden's rage would be
      furious when he learned what had interfered with the trade. He did not
      feel under any obligations to reveal his own agency in the matter, unless
      direct inquiry was made of him. In that case, he would manfully stand by
      his acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm expecting the man this afternoon, Mrs. Bickford," said Mr. Holden,
      "and shall stay around home to see him. When he comes, call me at once;
      and mind, not a word about Spitfire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you say. I wash my hands of the whole affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Washing your hands won't do you any harm," said Abner, with a laugh at
      what he supposed to be a witticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bickford took no notice of this remark. It was not quite easy to say
      why she remained in charge of Mr. Holden's household, for certainly, she
      had no respect for her employer. However, he did not meddle with her, or,
      if he did, he got the worst of it, and it was perhaps the independence
      that she enjoyed which led her to remain in the house. Knowing Abner's
      character, she was not particularly shocked at this last evidence of it,
      but went about her work as usual, with scarcely a thought of what had
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden sat at the window, and looked up the road, awaiting anxiously
      the appearance of the customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope he'll bring the money with him," he thought. "I'd like to have
      matters all arranged to-day, before he smells a rat. If I get the money
      once in my hands, he may scold all he pleases about the horse. It won't
      disturb my rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the old clock in the corner kept ticking&mdash;minute after minute
      passed&mdash;and still the stranger did not appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can't have struck a bargain with Sam Nichols," muttered Abner,
      apprehensively. "If he has, it'll be sort of a swindle on me. Maybe
      Nichols has been telling him lies about me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner waxed so angry over this supposition, that although it was merely
      conjecture, he already began to consider in what way he could "come up
      with Sam Nichols."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That money would come very handy," thought Abner. "There's a horse worth
      two of Spitfire, I can get for a hundred and fifty, and that would leave
      me a hundred. I wish he would come."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked out of the window, and, not content with that, went out of the
      front door, and, shading his eyes with his hands, looked up the road. But
      he could see nothing of Mr. Richmond. Abner began to fear that he had lost
      his bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess I'll put on my hat and go round to the tavern," he said to Mrs.
      Bickford. "If the gentleman I spoke of should call while I am away, just
      send the boy around after me as quick as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden walked hurriedly to the tavern, determined to bring about a
      bargain, which would be so desirable for him, if it were a possible thing.
      He must and would get rid of Spitfire, however many falsehoods he might
      have to tell. What was truth in comparison to two hundred and fifty
      dollars! Suppose Spitfire should run away with the stranger's wife and
      break her limbs, or even her neck, it was everybody's duty to look out for
      himself in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus reasoned Abner Holden. There is no particular need of my commenting
      upon the fallacy of this reasoning, since it is not likely that any of my
      young readers will sufficiently admire his character to be in any danger
      of being led into imitation of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a very few minutes, Abner stood on the piazza, of the
      tavern, a little out of breath with rapid walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. Richmond still here?" he inquired of the landlord, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but he means to leave in five minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In his room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see him on particular business&mdash;I wish you would send up
      and ask him to come down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "William," said the landlord, summoning his son, "go up and tell Mr.
      Richmond that Mr. Holden wishes to see him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know of his having bought a horse of Sam Nichols, do you?"
      asked Abner, nervously, of the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I am sure he has not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner felt somewhat relieved by this. As long as he was still unprovided
      with a horse, there was still a chance of Spitfire. He resolved, if
      necessary, to abate something from the rather high price he had demanded
      in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Richmond followed William downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish to see me?" he asked, glancing toward Mr. Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, about the horse you were looking at this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have concluded not to take him," said the other, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't buy of Sam Nichols, did you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; his horse did not suit me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't any other in your eye, have you?" asked Mr. Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, hadn't you better look at mine again?" he said, persuasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be of no use."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the price is any objection," said Abner, insinuatingly, "I don't know
      but I might say a LEETLE less, though the animal's wuth more'n I ask for
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't the price that stands in the way, Mr. Holden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, then? Sam Nichols hain't been slandering me, I hope. If he
      has, I'll be even with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare your anger against Sam Nichols. He said nothing against you; though
      I believe you warned me against him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I did. I felt it my duty to caution you, so you might not be
      overreached by him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You prefer to overreach me yourself," said the other, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner started, and changed color.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" he said. "Who told you I wanted to overreach you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, this is the way the matter stands. I asked you for a good family
      horse, such as my wife might drive with safety. Didn't you understand me
      so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you tried to sell me an ill-tempered brute, blind of one eye, for an
      extortionate price. Can you deny it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somebody's been telling you a pack of lies," said Abner, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think they are lies. I have every reason to think they are true.
      By the way, what is the animal's name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spitfire," said Abner, rather reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good name for a family horse," said the stranger, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you learn all this?" demanded Abner. "Who's been slandering the
      horse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got my information at your place, from one who ought to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      A light dawned upon Abner Holden's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert told him," muttered Abner to himself. "That cursed boy has
      spoiled my bargain, and he shall smart for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a furious rage, he retraced his steps homeward, breathing threats of
      vengeance dire against our hero.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A CRISIS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Abner Holden's disappointment was excessive at the sudden falling through
      of his horse trade, and his feeling of anger against Herbert for his
      agency in the matter was in proportion to his disappointment. His chief
      thought, as he hurried home from the tavern, was that he would make the
      boy smart for his interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give him a good flogging," muttered Abner to himself, and he felt
      that this would be some slight compensation for the injury and slight loss
      which Herbert had caused him to sustain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll teach him to spoil my bargains," he said, while his face wore an
      expression decidedly ugly. "I reckon he won't do it a second time."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this frame of mind that he reached home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had just entered the kitchen with an armful of wood for the
      housekeeper, and having thrown down his burden, was about to go back,
      when, on turning, he confronted the stormy and wrathful face of his
      employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's found out," Herbert concluded at once, and he braced his nerves for
      the storm which he knew must come.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, young man, I've an account to settle with you," said Abner,
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did not reply, but waited for Mr. Holden to state the matter. But
      in Abner's present angry condition, he chose to construe his silence into
      cause of offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you speak?" he said. "What do you mean by looking me impudently
      in the face?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no intention of being impudent," said Herbert. "I think you are
      mistaken, Mr. Holden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you dare to tell me I am mistaken?" roared Holden, lashing himself
      into a rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean to do or say anything that is not perfectly respectful,"
      said Herbert, manfully, looking steadily in his employer's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you tell a pack of lies about my horse this morning, and so make
      me lose my trade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't tell a pack of lies," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you tell the man who came here that he was an ill-tempered brute,
      and blind of one eye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden glared upon the boy as if he wanted to spring upon him, and
      give him a thrashing on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told him that Spitfire was not suitable for a family horse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you tell him that for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it was true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing it was true, didn't you know that you were spoiling my trade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry for that, Mr. Holden, but if he had bought the horse,
      supposing it to be gentle, it might have broken his wife's neck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What business was that of yours? That was his lookout."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't look upon it in that way. I thought he ought to buy the horse
      with his eyes open."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did, did you?" roared Abner. "Then I advise you to open your own
      eyes, for you're going to get one of the worst lickings you ever had."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden's anger now reached an ungovernable pitch. Looking about him
      for a weapon, he espied the broom resting against the wall. He seized it,
      and with a scream of rage, made for Herbert, shaking off the grasp of the
      housekeeper, who tried to stay him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, perceiving the peril in which he stood, ran round the table,
      which stood, with leaves open, in the middle of the floor. Abner pursued
      him with headlong haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord preserve us! The man is mad!" ejaculated the housekeeper, trying to
      get out of the way. But in this she was not successful. The kitchen was
      small, and before she could guard against a collision, Abner had stumbled
      over Mrs. Bickford, and both came down together. She uttered a succession
      of piercing shrieks, and, with a view of relieving Herbert, pretended that
      her life was in danger, grasping Abner by the hair and holding him fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert saw that this was the favorable moment for escape, and, seizing
      his hat, dashed out of the house. He ran across the fields as fast as his
      limbs could carry him, expecting that he would be pursued. Before we
      follow him, we will describe the scene that took place after his flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let go my hair, Mrs. Bickford!" exclaimed Abner, tugging vainly to break
      from the housekeeper's grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare not," she said. "I'm afraid you'll murder me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are making a fool of yourself," retorted Abner. "What should I murder
      you for? But I will, if you don't let go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, who's talking of murder?" demanded a rough voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker was a neighbor, who chanced to be passing, and was led to
      enter by the uproar, which was plainly audible outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Save me!" exclaimed Mrs. Bickford. "He's threatened to murder me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop your nonsense, you old fool!" retorted Abner, vexed at the equivocal
      position in which he was placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's all this row about? Mr. Holden, you ought to be ashamed of
      yourself for attacking a defenseless woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't intend to," said Abner, sullenly. "She got in my way, and I
      stumbled over her; and then she seized me by the hair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were you going to do with that broom?" demanded the other,
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was I going to do? I was going to thrash that rascally boy of mine,
      and Mrs. Bickford knew it perfectly well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has he done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He? He's spoiled a trade of mine by his lying, and I was going to flog
      him for it, when Mrs. Bickford got in my way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the visitor, shrugging his shoulders, "I don't want to
      interfere in your affairs. I suppose that you've a right to flog the boy,
      but it strikes me that a broom handle is rather an ugly weapon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't half heavy enough," said Abner, savagely; "but where is the boy?
      Did you see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Given leg-bail, I reckon, and I don't wonder at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run away?" ejaculated Abner, disappointed. "Did you see where he went?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I didn't, and if I had, I'm not sure that I would tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner would like to have thrashed the man who showed so little sympathy
      with his anger, but he felt that it would hardly be prudent. He went to
      the door and looked out. But there was no trace of Herbert to be
      discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll get it when he does come back," he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that Herbert might not come back at all never once occurred to
      him. He resolved that the flogging should lose nothing by being deferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now return to Herbert, whom we left running across the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      His departure had been so sudden, that his prominent idea was to get out
      of the way of his employer's violence. He was at first under the
      impression that he was pursued, but when, after running perhaps a quarter
      of a mile, he ventured to look around, he saw, to his great relief, that
      there was no one on his track. Being out of breath, he stopped, and,
      throwing himself down on the grass in the shadow of a stone wall, began to
      consider his plans for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was in doubt except one point. He felt that he had broken,
      finally, the tie that bound him to Mr. Holden. He would not return to him.
      He had experienced enough of Abner's ugly and unreasonable temper to feel
      that there could be no harmony between them, and as to submitting to
      personal violence from such a man as that, his blood boiled at the
      thought. He knew that he should resist with all the strength he possessed,
      and what the result might be he did not dare to think. What lay before him
      in the future he could not conjecture, but whatever it might be, he felt
      that it was better than to remain an inmate of Abner Holden's household,
      and in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where should he go? That was a question not easily answered. After his
      experience of his uncle's indifference to him, he did not wish to appeal
      to him for aid, yet he felt that he should like to go to New York and try
      his fortune there. Thousands of people lived there, and earned enough to
      support them comfortably. Why not he? It was a thousand miles off, and he
      might be some time in getting there. He might have to stop and work on the
      way. But, sooner or later, he resolved that he would find his way to the
      great metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one difficulty which presented itself at the outset. This
      difficulty related to his clothing. He had on a pair of overalls and a
      ragged vest which Abner had provided for him, intending that he should
      save the good suit he brought with him for Sundays. His present suit,
      which had been worn by half a dozen of his predecessors, Herbert decidedly
      objected to wearing, as, in addition to being faded and worn, it was by no
      means a good fit. He must get his other suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was in Mr. Holden's attic, and it would hardly be prudent to
      venture back for it, as Abner was on the lookout for him, and there would
      be a collision, and perhaps he might be forcibly detained. Fortunately,
      his money he had about him. This amounted, as the reader already knows, to
      nearly fifteen dollars, and would, no doubt, be of essential service to
      him in the project which he had undertaken. As to the clothes, he must
      think of a way of securing them, before setting out on his journey to New
      York.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      RALPH THE RANGER
    </h3>
    <p>
      One thing was certain. There was no chance of obtaining the clothes at
      present. Probably his best course would be to wait till night, and then
      come back to the house on the chance of gaining Mrs. Bickford's attention.
      In the meantime, probably, the best thing to be done was to conceal
      himself temporarily in a belt of woods lying about a mile back of Abner
      Holden's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as his breath was recovered, Herbert got up, and headed for these
      woods. A few minutes found him in the midst of them. He made his way with
      some difficulty through the underbrush, parting the thick stems with his
      hands, until he reached a comparatively open space of perhaps an acre in
      extent. In the midst of this space a rude hut was visible, constructed of
      logs, and covered with the branches of trees. In front of it, sitting on
      the stump of a tree, which perhaps had been spared for that purpose, sat a
      tall man, with very brown complexion, clad in a rough hunting suit. His
      form, though spare, was tough and sinewy, and the muscles of his bare arms
      seemed like whipcords. A short, black pipe was in his mouth. The only
      covering of his head was the rough, grizzled hair, which looked as if for
      months it had never felt the touch of a comb or brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, though he had never before seen this singular being, recognized
      him at once as Ralph the Ranger, as he was properly called in the village.
      For years he had lived a hermit-like existence in the forest, supporting
      himself mainly by his rifle. This was not difficult, for his wants were
      few and simple. What cause led him to shun the habitations of his kind,
      and make his dwelling in the woods, no one knew, and perhaps no one ever
      would know, for of himself he was silent, and it was not easy to draw him
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up as he heard Herbert's step, and said, abruptly: "Well, boy,
      what do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner was rough, but our hero was not afraid. He answered frankly, "I
      am hiding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hiding? Who from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Abner Holden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! Why should you hide from him? What has he to do with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am bound to him, and he is angry with me because he thinks I interfered
      in a trade of his. He wanted to beat me, so I ran away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" said Ralph, approvingly. "Tell me about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert drew near, and told his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph listened attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boy," said he, "I think you are honest. There are not many that can be
      said of. As for Abner Holden, I know him. He's a mean skinflint. Pah!" and
      he spit, contemptuously. "You'd better not go back to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean to," said Herbert, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are your plans? Have you formed any?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to go to New York."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To New York," repeated Ralph, thoughtfully. "You wish to get into the
      crowd, while I seek to avoid it. But it is natural to youth. At your age,
      it was so with me. I hope, my boy, the time will not come when you, like
      me, will wish to shun the sight of men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert listened in sympathy, not unmingled with surprise, to the speech
      of this man, which was quite superior to what might have been expected
      from one of his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When do you wish to start?" asked Ralph, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, I want to get my clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my room, at Mr. Holden's house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you expect to get them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Bickford, the housekeeper, is a friend of mine. I thought I might go
      there to-night, and attract her attention without rousing Mr. Holden. She
      would get them for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! I will go with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you?" asked Herbert, gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had felt a little doubt as to the result of his expedition, as, if Mr.
      Holden should be awake and start in pursuit, he would stand a good chance
      of being captured, which, above all things, he most dreaded. But with so
      able an auxiliary as Ralph, he knew he could bid easy defiance to Abner,
      however much the latter might desire to molest him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I will stand by you, and you shall share my cabin with me as long as
      you like. You are not afraid of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Herbert, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph looked kindly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of the children run from me," he said. "It is not strange, perhaps,
      for I look savage, I suppose, but you do well to trust me. I will be your
      friend, and that is something I have not said to any living being for
      years. I like your face. It is brave and true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for your favorable opinion, Mr.&mdash;" Here Herbert paused in
      uncertainty, for he had never heard Ralph's surname.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call me Ralph. I have done with the title of \ civilization. Call me
      Ralph. That will suit me best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for your kindness, then, Ralph."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert&mdash;Herbert Mason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Herbert, I think you must be hungry. Have you eaten your dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you shall share mine. My food is of the plainest, but such as it is,
      you are welcome. Come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert entered the cabin. The only table was a plank supported at each
      end by a barrel. From a box in the corner Ralph drew out some corn-bread
      and some cold meat. He took a tin measure, and, going out of the cabin,
      filled it with water from a brook near by. This he placed on the rude
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All is ready," he said. "Take and eat, if my food is not too rude."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did eat, and with appetite. He was a growing boy, whose appetite
      seldom failed him, and he had been working hard since breakfast, which he
      had taken at six, while it was now one o'clock. No wonder he was hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph looked on with approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the first that has shared my meal for many a long day," he said.
      "Day after day, and year after year, I have broken my fast alone, but it
      seems pleasant, after all," he said, musingly. "Men are treacherous and
      deceitful, but you," he said, resting his glance on the frank, ingenuous
      face of his youthful guest, "you must be honest and true, or I am greatly
      deceived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you will find me so," said Herbert, interested more and more in
      the rough-looking recluse, about whose life he suspected there must be
      some sad secret, of which the world knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dispatching the meal provided by his hospitable entertainer, Herbert
      sat down on the grass just outside the cabin, and watched lazily the smoke
      which issued from Ralph's pipe, as it rose in many a fantastic curl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long have you lived here, Ralph?" asked our hero at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten years," said the recluse, removing his pipe from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a long time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, boy, a long time in the life of one as young as you, but to me it
      seems but yesterday that I built this cabin and established myself here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not often lonely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lonely? Yes, but not more so than I should be in the haunts of men. I
      have company, too. There are the squirrels that leap from bough to bough
      of the tall trees. Then there are the birds that wake me with their
      singing. They are company for me. They are better company than men. They,
      at least, will not deceive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and bent his eyes upon the ground. He was thinking, not of the
      boy beside him, but of some time in the past, and the recollection
      apparently was not pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon wore away at length, and the shadows deepened in the woods.
      Herbert wandered about, and succeeded in gathering some nuts, which he
      carried to Ralph's cabin. When eight o'clock came, the Ranger said: "You
      had better lie down and rest, my boy; I will wake you up at twelve, and we
      will go together to Holden's place, and see if we can get your clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this proposal Herbert willingly assented, as he began to feel tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept, he knew not how long, when he was gently shaken by Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where am I?" he asked, rubbing his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the Ranger bending over him soon brought back the
      recollection of his position, and he sprang up promptly. Ralph showed him
      an easier way out of the woods than that by which he had entered, and less
      embarrassed by the growth of underbrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour they were standing by Abner Holden's house. It was
      perfectly dark, the inmates probably being fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know where the housekeeper sleeps," said Herbert. "I'll throw up a
      pebble at her window, and perhaps it will wake her up."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did as proposed. Mrs. Bickford, who was a light sleeper, heard, and
      went to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's there?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is I, Mrs. Bickford," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, Herbert? Shall I let you in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I don't want to come in. All I want is my clothes. They are up in my
      trunk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go up and get them for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went upstairs and quickly returned with the clothes, which she let
      down from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you hungry, Herbert?" she asked. "Let me bring you something to eat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you, Mrs. Bickford; I am stopping with Ralph the Ranger. He has
      kindly given me all the food I want."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do? Are you going to stop with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I am going East in a day or two. I am going to New York. I will write
      to you from there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to have you go, Herbert. I wish things could have been
      pleasanter, so that you might have stayed. But I think I hear Mr. Holden
      stirring. Good-by, and may God be with you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed the window hastily, and Herbert, not wishing to get into a
      collision with Abner Holden, who he suspected might have heard something,
      withdrew swiftly. Ralph, who was standing near by, joined him, and both
      together went back to the woods.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A MOMENT OF PERIL
    </h3>
    <p>
      Abner Holden did not suspect that Herbert actually intended to leave him
      permanently; but when evening came, and he did not return, he became
      apprehensive that such was the case. Now, for more than one reason, he
      objected to our hero's leaving. First, because he was a strong, capable
      boy, and his services were worth considerable, and, secondly, because he
      disliked Herbert, and it was a satisfaction to tyrannize over him, as his
      position enabled him to do. There are some men in whom the instinct of
      petty tyranny exists to such an extent that they cannot feel happy without
      someone to exercise their authority over. Such a man was Abner Holden. He
      was a bully and a tyrant by nature, and decidedly objected to losing one
      so completely in his power as Herbert was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When night came and Herbert did not return, he decided to search for him,
      and bring him back, if found, the very next day. He did not impart his
      purpose to Mrs. Bickford, for he was at no loss to discover that the
      sympathies of the kind-hearted housekeeper were not with him, but with the
      boy whom he wished to abuse. When breakfast was over, therefore, he merely
      said: "Mrs. Bickford, I am going out for a short time. If Herbert should
      return while I am absent, you may tell him to finish hoeing those potatoes
      in the garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think he will come back, Mr. Holden?" asked the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; he will soon be tired of wandering about. He will learn to prize a
      good home after he has slept out of doors one night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bickford did not reply; but she did not feel quite so much confidence
      as her employer appeared to do in the excellence of the home which Herbert
      had enjoyed under Abner Holden's roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just as well he doesn't suspect Herbert's plan," she thought, and
      without further words, began to clear away the breakfast dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner was not long in deciding that Herbert was hidden in the woods. That,
      indeed, seemed the most natural place of refuge for one placed in his
      circumstances. He determined, therefore, to seek there first.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now return to Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will wait till nightfall," said Ralph, "you will be more safe from
      pursuit, and I will accompany you for a few miles."
    </p>
    <p>
      This seemed plausible, and our hero consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph went off on a hunting expedition, but Herbert remained behind,
      fearing that he might tear or stain his clothes, of which it was
      necessary, now, to be careful. How to pass the time was the question. To
      tell the truth, the hunter's cabin contained little that would help him.
      There were no books visible, for Ralph seemed to have discarded everything
      that would remind him of that civilization which he had forsaken in
      disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert went outside, and watched the squirrels that occasionally made
      their appearance flitting from branch to branch of the tall trees. After a
      while his attention was drawn to a bird, which flew with something in its
      beak nearly to the top of a tall tree not far off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't wonder," thought Herbert, interested, "if she's got a nest,
      and some young ones up there. I have a great mind to climb up and see
      whether she has or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      He measured the tree with his eye. It was very tall, exceeding in its
      height most of its forest neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know as I can climb it," he said to himself, a little doubtfully;
      "but anyway, I am going to try. There's nothing like trying."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a lucky determination for Herbert, as will speedily appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was twenty feet to the first branching off, and this was, of course,
      the most difficult part of the ascent, since it was necessary to "shin
      up," and the body of the tree was rather too large to clasp comfortably.
      However, it was not the first time that Herbert had climbed a tree, and he
      was not deficient in courage as well as skill. So he pushed on his way,
      and though once or twice in danger of falling, he at length succeeded in
      reaching the first bough. From this point the ascent was comparatively
      easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time our hero was elated to find himself probably fifty feet
      from the ground, so high it made him feel a little dizzy to look down. He
      reached the nest, and found the young birds&mdash;three in number. The
      parent bird hovered near by, evidently quite alarmed for the safety of her
      brood. But Herbert had no intention of harming them. He only climbed up to
      gratify his curiosity, and because he had nothing more important to do.
      Though he did not know it, his own danger was greater than that which
      threatened the birds. For, just at that moment, Mr. Holden, in his
      wanderings, had reached Ralph's cabin, and Herbert, looking down, beheld,
      with some anxiety, the figure of the unwelcome visitor. He saw Abner enter
      the cabin, and, after a few moments' interval, issue from it with an air
      of disappointment and dissatisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How lucky," thought our hero, "that he did not find me inside!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden looked about him in every direction but the right one. He
      little dreamed that the object of his pursuit was looking down upon him,
      securely, from above.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think he'll find me," thought Herbert. "Wouldn't he give
      something, though, to know where I am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But our young hero was doomed to disappointment. Just at that moment&mdash;the
      unluckiest that could have been selected&mdash;he was seized with a strong
      inclination to sneeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed lest the sound should betray him, he made desperate efforts to
      suppress it but Nature would have its way, and probably did so with
      greater violence than if no resistance had been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ker-chew!" sneezed Herbert, violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he anticipated, Abner's attention was attracted by the loud noise,
      which he rightly concluded could hardly proceed from a bird or squirrel.
      He had just been on the point of leaving the cabin for some other part of
      the woods, but at this sound he stood still. Looking up to discover whence
      it proceeded, his keen eyes detected Herbert in his lofty perch. His eyes
      sparkled with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, you young rascal!" he exclaimed. "So you are there, are you? You were
      going to run away, were you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Herbert was actually discovered, his fear left him, and he became
      perfectly self-possessed and confident.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Mr. Holden," he answered, quietly; "such is my intention."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Boldly spoken," said Abner, provoked by our hero's coolness, for he had
      hoped to find him terrified and pleading for forgiveness. "I admire your
      frankness, and will try to equal it. I suppose you'll give it up as a bad
      job now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said Herbert, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, sir," said Abner, in anger and astonishment. "Take care how
      you defy me. Come down here at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?" inquired Herbert, without stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?" repeated Abner Holden. "That I may flog you within an inch of
      your life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's no inducement," said our hero, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you refuse to obey me?" shouted Abner, stamping angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I refuse to be flogged. You don't get me down for any such purpose, Mr.
      Holden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, by Heaven, if you won't come otherwise, I'll come up and help you
      down."
    </p>
    <p>
      The angry man at once commenced the ascent. Anger gave him strength, and,
      though he was unaccustomed to climbing, he continued to mount up about
      halfway to the first branching off, somewhat to Herbert's uneasiness, for
      he felt there was a chance that he might fall into Abner's clutches.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Abner's success was only temporary. At the height of a dozen feet he
      began to slip, and, despite his frantic struggles, he slid gradually to
      the ground, tearing his coat, which he had not taken the precaution to
      remove, and blistering his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      In his anger and excitement, he drew a pistol from his breast pocket, and
      pointed upward, saying menacingly, "Come down at once, you young rascal,
      or I will fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was startled. He did not believe the pistol to be loaded. Still it
      might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come down?" repeated Abner, fiercely. "Quick, or I fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert's cheek was pale, but in a resolute voice he answered, "I will
      not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holder, laid his finger upon the trigger, and would, in his anger,
      have carried his threat into execution; but at the critical moment he was
      conscious of a violent blow, and the pistol was wrenched from his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning quickly, he met the stern glance of Ralph the Ranger.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TAKEN PRISONER
    </h3>
    <p>
      "What does all this mean?" demanded Ralph, in a tone of command.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What right have you to interfere?" said Abner Holden, sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The right that any man has to prevent murder," said Ralph, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wasn't going to murder him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were you going to do?" asked Ralph, looking keenly at Abner. "Why
      were you pointing the pistol at him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to frighten him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You meant to have him think you were going to fire. I believe you were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't he come down when I bade him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll answer that question," said Herbert, from the top of the tree. "Mr.
      Holden promised to beat me if I would come down, but I didn't think that a
      sufficient inducement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a right to beat you," said Abner, doggedly. "Ain't you bound to
      me; tell me that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was," said Herbert, "and if you had treated me well, I would have
      stayed with you; but I don't mean to remain to be abused."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear the lad's answer," said Ralph. "I like his spirit, and I'll
      stand by him. He won't return with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      While this conversation had been going on, Abner had been slowly edging
      himself toward the spot upon which Ralph had thrown the pistol, which he
      had wrenched from him. While Ralph was speaking, he suddenly darted
      forward, seized the weapon, and, facing about, said, with malicious
      triumph, "Now, you're in my power, both of you. We'll see whether he'll go
      back with me or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he pointed the pistol toward Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter laughed contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      This irritated Abner Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will count ten," he said. "Unless the boy begins to come down before I
      stop, I fire at you. One&mdash;two&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold!" said Ralph, and, drawing his revolver from beneath his
      hunting-jacket, he pointed it at Abner. "Two can play at that game, Abner
      Holden. This revolver is fully loaded. It gives me six chances of hitting
      you. You have but one chance with your pistol. The moment your finger
      touches the trigger, your doom is sealed. I never miss my aim."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sickly hue overspread the face of Abner Holden. He had counted on
      Ralph's being unarmed. He saw that he had made an important and most
      unlucky mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put down your revolver," he said, in a very different tone. "I wasn't in
      earnest, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing of the kind," retorted Ralph. "You looked to me as if you
      were very much in earnest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still with his revolver he covered Abner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put down your weapon," said Abner, nervously. "It might go off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it might," returned Ralph. "I will lower it, on one condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you lay down your pistol on the ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner demurred, but finally felt compelled to do as he was commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is well," said Ralph, quietly. "Now, I will take care that you are
      not tempted by it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked toward the pistol, lifted it, and, pointing it in the reverse
      direction, fired it off among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much for that," he said. "Now, Herbert, you may come down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert complied promptly. He felt the utmost confidence in the prowess
      and good faith of his new friend, and did not fear to descend, though his
      bitterest enemy awaited him beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile an idea struck Abner Holden. He saw that he was no match for
      Herbert as long as Ralph chose to befriend him. He resolved to enlist the
      latter on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark you, Ralph," he said, "come aside with me. I wish to speak to you a
      moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph followed him a few paces in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now what is it you have to say to me?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About this boy," said Abner, insinuatingly. "He is bound to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the law gives me authority over him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want him to go back with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you promise not to interfere between us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't promise that," said Ralph, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay a moment," said Abner, seeing that he was on the point of leaving
      him; "of course, I am willing to make it worth your while. I'll give you&mdash;well,
      three dollars, to help me secure him, and carry him back to my house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you take me for?" asked Ralph, looking at the other, steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a poor man," said Abner. "Think a moment. Three dollars will buy you
      provisions for a week. They couldn't be more easily earned. In fact, you
      needn't do anything. Only promise not to interfere between the boy and
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph turned upon him scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have promised the boy my protection," he said, "and you would have me
      forfeit my word for a paltry three dollars?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give you five," said Abner, supposing that the sum he had offered
      was not sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for five dollars, nor five thousand," returned Ralph, shortly. "I
      thought you meant to insult me, but I see you only judge me by yourself.
      The boy shall not return with you. Make up your mind to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can have you arrested," said Abner, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let that comfort you for the loss of the boy," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have the boy, too," muttered Abner, turning to leave them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?" demanded Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" demanded Abner, facing about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I can't spare you yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What right have you to interfere with my movements?" said Abner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None, perhaps; but I will inquire into that afterward. It is enough that,
      for the present, you must stay here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall do no such thing," said Abner, and he again turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph deliberately lifted his weapon, and took aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you say now?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely, you will not fire at me," said Abner, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if you remain where you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long do you mean to keep me?" demanded Abner, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As long as may be necessary. That is all. Herbert, go into the cabin and
      look in one corner for a cord."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert soon returned with a stout cord, tough and strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do with that?" asked Abner suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to bind you," said Ralph, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have the law on you for this," said Abner, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All in good time," said Ralph. "But I advise you to consider whether the
      law has nothing to say against attempted murder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that you attempted to murder this boy, and would have done so, in
      all probability, if I had not interfered. When I am arrested, I shall feel
      it my duty to make this known to the authorities."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner was silent. He felt that Ralph's testimony would have an ugly look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me go," he said, after a pause. "You needn't be afraid of my
      troubling either of you. Don't tie me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abner Holden," said Ralph, "I know you, and I know you are not to be
      trusted. I have resolved to help this boy to escape from you, and I mean
      to do it effectually. For this purpose, I must subject you to temporary
      inconvenience. I advise you not to resist."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had already tied the hands of Abner Holden, who, as he looked into the
      fearless, resolute face of the Ranger, felt that it would not do to
      resist. It chafed him most to think that Herbert, his bound boy, should be
      a witness of his humiliation, and he scowled savagely at our hero. But
      Herbert showed no triumph. His was a brave and generous nature, and had it
      rested with him, he would have let Mr. Holden go, but he did not think it
      best to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph quickly tied both hands and feet, and then took the helpless body of
      Abner into the cabin, where he placed him in one corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you thirsty?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Abner, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph placed a cup of water to his lips. He also placed a loaf of bread
      beside him, which, though his hands were tied at the wrist, he would still
      be able to reach, and then beckoned to Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," he said, "it is time that we were going."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner gnashed his teeth with anger, as he watched them issue from the
      cabin together, and felt how utterly helpless he was to prevent them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A FOUR-FOOTED FOE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Abner Holden's reflections, when he found himself left alone in Ralph's
      cabin, bound hand and foot, were not of the most agreeable nature. It was
      humiliating to find himself baffled at every point, and, for once,
      completely defeated in his attempt to exercise his authority over the boy
      who had been bound to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Herbert should escape from him beyond the chance of recovery seemed
      now almost certain. If he were free, something might be done. But he was
      so securely bound that it was impossible to get free without help, and the
      lonely situation of the cabin made it very doubtful whether anyone would
      come within hearing until the return of Ralph himself. When that would be
      was uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours passed, and still no prospect of release. The bonds chafed his
      wrists, and his situation was far from comfortable. He tried to loosen the
      cords, but without success.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must I stay here all night?" he thought, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But deliverance was at hand, though its first approach was disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large dog entered the cabin through the open door, drawn thither,
      probably, by curiosity. When he saw Abner he appeared to take a dislike to
      him, and barked vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go away, you brute!" said Abner, wrathfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog, however, appeared instinctively to understand that Abner Holden
      was able only to threaten him, and barked more furiously than before;
      sometimes approaching within a foot of the helpless prisoner, and showing
      a formidable row of teeth, which Abner feared every moment might fasten
      upon his arm or leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden was not a man of courage. Though his disposition was that of
      a bully, he was easily frightened, and the fierce look of the dog alarmed
      him not a little. In fact, it might have tested the courage of a much
      braver man than Mr. Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go away!" he shrieked, shrinking back as far as he could from the open
      mouth of his persecutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hoarse bark was the only reply, and the dog made an artful spring, which
      was only a feint, but had too much the appearance of earnest to suit his
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, will nobody save me from the brute?" groaned Abner, in an ecstasy of
      terror. "If I could only get my hands loose!" and he tugged frantically at
      the cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling how utterly he was at a disadvantage, he condescended to coax his
      fierce antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be quiet, that's a good dog," he said, with hypocritical softness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog noticed a change in his tone, and evidently viewed it with some
      suspicion. Still his bark became less fierce and his looks less
      threatening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good dog!" repeated Abner, in wheedling tones. "There's some dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he pushed over the provisions which Ralph had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the dog was apparently taking his offer into consideration, a boy's
      voice was heard outside, calling "Carlo, Carlo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog pricked up his ears and ran out of the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are here, you truant," said the boy. "Why did you run away? What
      have you to say for yourself, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog answered by a wag of his tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, you may wag your tail, but I've a great mind to punish you for
      running away, and putting me to the trouble of finding you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello!" cried Abner, in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's that?" thought the boy, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the voice evidently came from within the cabin, he ventured to the
      door, and looked in. He was considerably surprised to see Abner Holden,
      whom he knew well by sight, lying bound hand and foot in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that you, Mr. Holden?" he asked, in a tone of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it is," said Abner, who was not in a very pleasant frame of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you tied?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you see I am?" snarled Abner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who tied you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That rascal Ralph. I mean to have him hung, if I live."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ralph! Why, I thought he was quiet and peaceable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He tried to murder me, but changed his mind, and tied me, as you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't understand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need of understanding it. Come and unfasten these cords. I
      feel stiff and cramped."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy tried to unfasten the cord, but it was too securely tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is your knife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't got any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then take the axe."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an axe standing at the corner of the room. This the boy got,
      and, with the keen edge, severed the string.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner stretched himself to relieve his cramped limbs. Then he bethought
      himself of his late persecutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that your dog?" he asked, surveying his four-legged enemy with no
      friendly expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's Carlo. Come here, Carlo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's been in here barking at me, and threatening to bite me, and now I'll
      have my revenge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" inquired the boy, in alarm, as Abner seized the axe
      and swung it over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand aside, boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to kill that brute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, he's a good dog. He won't do any harm," said the boy, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll kill him," said Abner, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog surveyed his enemy with suspicion. He seemed to understand that
      danger menaced him. He growled in a low, hoarse, ominous tone, which
      showed that he was on his guard, and meant to do his part of the fighting,
      if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      His owner had retreated to the door, and now tried to call him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carlo, Carlo, come out here, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Carlo would not come. He had no intention of shrinking from the danger
      that threatened him, but was bent on defending himself, as became a brave
      and dauntless dog, whose courage was above suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Abner had not been so exasperated, he might have been terrified, but
      anger re-enforced his courage, and, moreover, he had a great deal of
      confidence that the axe which he held in his hand would make him more than
      a match for the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll kill him!" he exclaimed, and once more he swung the axe over his
      head, and brought it down with a tremendous force in the direction of the
      dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas for poor Carlo, if the axe had struck him! But he was wary, and knew
      something of warlike tactics, and with watchful eye carefully noted
      Abner's movements. The boy uttered a cry of alarm at the peril of his
      favorite, but Carlo sprang to one side just as the axe descended, and it
      was buried in the earthen floor of the cabin so deeply that Abner could
      not immediately recover it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advantage was thus transferred to the other side, and the dog was not
      slow in perceiving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a bound he sprang upon his adversary, and bore him to the floor,
      seizing his coat between his strong teeth. He pulled and tugged at this
      with a strength which no ordinary cloth could possibly withstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take him off! take him off!" shrieked Abner in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy sprang to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come away, Carlo," he said, grasping him by the collar; "come away,
      that's a good dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      But, habitually obedient as Carlo was, his young master found it difficult
      to get him away. He felt that he had received a grievous injury&mdash;that
      his life had been attempted&mdash;and he wanted to have satisfaction.
      Finally his master succeeded in drawing him away, but not till Mr.
      Holden's coat was badly torn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was crestfallen and angry, and not so grateful as he ought to
      have been to his young defender.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll make your father pay for this coat, you young rascal!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't my fault, Mr. Holden," said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is. It was your dog that tore my coat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carlo wouldn't have torn it, if you hadn't attacked him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He attacked me first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better go away, Mr. Holden, or he may go at you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      A low growl from the dog whom he held by the collar re-enforced this
      suggestion, and Abner, uttering threats both against the dog and his
      master, strode out of the cabin and bent his steps homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the kitchen, the housekeeper turned, and, noticing his torn
      coat, exclaimed, "Good gracious, Mr. Holden, what's happened to you? How
      came your coat so badly torn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a dog," muttered Abner, who did not care to be questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bickford supposed he must have taken off the coat, and the dog had
      torn it as it lay upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity!" she exclaimed. "Whose dog was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alfred Martin's. I'll make Martin pay for the coat. He has no right to
      keep such a brute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be hungry, Mr. Holden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, get me something as quick as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen anything of Herbert?" asked the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," snapped Abner.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a falsehood, of course, but he felt rather ashamed to confess
      that he had seen Herbert, and that the latter had got the better of him.
      Mrs. Bickford perceived that he was out of humor, and did not press the
      question. She concluded that he was angry because his quest had been
      unsuccessful.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      JUST TOO LATE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Leaving Abner Holden bound in his cabin, Ralph led Herbert, by a short
      path, out of the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your best course," he said, "will be to take the cars for Columbus at
      Vernon. At Columbus you will go to Wheeling, and from there, over the
      Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad to Baltimore, and thence to New York. But
      all this will cost money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have money," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About fifteen dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not enough to carry me to New York?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hardly. Besides, when you get there, how will you get along? Have you any
      relations in the city?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, an uncle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will go to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Herbert, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does not care to see me. Shall I tell you what sort of a letter he
      wrote to Dr. Kent about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, in indignant language, which correctly represented his feelings,
      gave the substance of the letter, which is already known to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not feel easy," he said, "until I am able to return the ten
      dollars which my uncle sent me. I am not willing to remain under
      obligations to one who cares so little for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you are proud," said Ralph, bending his eyes upon the lad's
      glowing countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I am," said Herbert; "but is it not a proper pride?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say no," answered Ralph; "but would you feel the same about
      incurring obligations to a friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Herbert; "that would be different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to hear you say so, for I am going to ask you to accept help
      from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      To Herbert's surprise, Ralph drew out a small bag, originally intended for
      shot, and drew therefrom five golden coins, of five dollars each.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take them," he said, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert hesitated, while his face indicated extreme surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought&mdash;" he commenced, and then paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You thought me poor," said Ralph, finishing the sentence for him. "Is it
      not so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most people think so," said Ralph. "But it was not poverty that drove me
      from the busy world to this solitude. Rich or poor, I had money enough for
      my wants. Here I have little use for money. To me it is a useless and
      valueless thing. You need have no hesitation in taking this. But on second
      thoughts, I had better give you more." And he was about to draw forth
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said Herbert, hastily. "It is quite sufficient. You are very,
      very kind. Some time I hope to repay you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Ralph. "Do not talk of repayment. Let me have the pleasure of
      giving you this small sum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How kind you are," said Herbert, impulsively, "and to a stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet my obligation to you is greater than yours to me," said Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can that be?" asked the boy, raising his eyes to Ralph's grave face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the first human being in whose society I have taken pleasure for
      years. Deeply injured by man, I conceived a hatred for the whole race. But
      in your frank face I see much to like. I think I could trust you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have inspired in me a new feeling, for which I cannot account.
      Yesterday the world had no attractions for me. To-day I feel an interest
      in your welfare, at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you bury yourself in this lonely place?" said Herbert. "You cannot
      be happy in it. Come with me to New York. It must be a beautiful place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph smiled gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the young the world seems bright," he said. "It is after years have
      swept away one illusion after another, after faith in one's fellowmen has
      been sorely tried, and the hollowness of the world's friendship has been
      proved, that the brightness fades."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have seen more of life than I," said Herbert, "and perhaps it is
      presumption in me to question what you say; but I cannot help feeling that
      you are mistaken. I am sure that there is such a thing as true
      friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many true friends are you blessed with?" asked Ralph, a little
      sarcasm in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not many, perhaps, but some. There is good Dr. Kent and his family. I am
      sure of their friendship. Then," he added, his color slightly rising, "I
      think I have found another friend," and he looked in the face of his
      guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave face softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my lad," said Ralph. "You are right there, at least. You can
      rely upon my friendship being sincere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I am right, am I not?" said Herbert, smiling brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you are," said the guide, after a pause, "and I thank you for
      teaching me a lesson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man was made in the image of God," said Herbert. "If we doubt man, I
      think it is the same as doubting God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph did not reply, but walked on in thoughtful silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How far is it to Vernon?" asked Herbert, when they had emerged from the
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is five miles farther. Can you walk so far?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes; I have good stout legs. But suppose Mr. Holden should escape. He
      might pursue us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I shall find him in the same place when I return," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will be very angry with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I suppose so," said Ralph, indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not afraid he will have you arrested?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I care little. If I am fined, I will pay the fine, and that will be
      the end of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you might be imprisoned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I see any danger of that, I shall be tempted to charge Abner Holden
      with his attempt upon your life. Don't make yourself anxious about me, my
      lad. I have little fear of what the law may do as far as my agency in this
      affair is concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph seemed so entirely unconcerned that something of his confidence was
      imparted to Herbert. Noting the erect mien and fearless glance of his
      guide, every movement betokening strength, he could not help feeling that
      Abner Holden would be rash to make such a man his enemy. He felt safe in
      his protection, and his apprehensions of capture passed away. So with
      lightened heart he walked the five dusty miles to the village of Vernon,
      accompanied by Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a thrifty village, with neat and tasteful dwellings lining the
      principal street. The railroad and manufactories had built it up rapidly
      and given it an air of prosperity which was pleasant to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will go at once to the railway station," said Ralph. "You may catch
      the next train, and it will be as well to leave this neighborhood as soon
      as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were fortunate enough to reach the station fifteen minutes before the
      eastern train departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert bought a ticket for Columbus, fifty miles distant, and entered the
      train.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by, Herbert," said Ralph, from the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by," said Herbert. "Thank you for all your kindness to me. Shall I
      not see you again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know," said Ralph, musing. "I have no wish nor intention of
      going to New York at present, yet I have a feeling that we shall meet
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it may be so," said Herbert. "I shall be glad to see you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke the shrill sound of the railway whistle was heard, the
      train started, and Herbert was fairly off on his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was leaving the depot, a wagon drove hastily up to the station,
      and Abner Holden jumped out. Herbert saw him as he looked from the window,
      and for a moment he was apprehensive, but the train was fairly on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop! stop!" vociferated Abner. "Stop, I say!" for he had also caught
      sight of his bound boy on the way to freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't think they will stop the train for you, you fool!" said a man
      standing by. "You ought to have come sooner if you wanted to go by this
      train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to go by it," said Abner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy's run away, and I have just seen him aboard the train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's it, is it? Your son?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I hope not. It's a young rascal that's bound to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he's a young rascal, I shouldn't think you'd want him back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning away, for he saw that he had failed, his glance rested on Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly his anger rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's your doings," said he, shaking his fist in impotent wrath at the
      sturdy hunter, whom he would have attacked had he dared. "It's your fault,
      and you shall pay for it if there's law in the land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will the law say to your attempt to shoot the boy?" demanded Ralph,
      coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner turned pale, and realized that his best course was to keep quiet
      about an affair which might seriously compromise himself.

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NEW ACQUAINTANCES
    </h3>
    <p>
      Herbert stopped overnight at Columbus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first train eastward left Columbus at seven o'clock in the morning. It
      was Herbert's intention to take this train, but unfortunately, as he
      thought at the time, the clock at the hotel by which his movements were
      guided was ten minutes too slow. The consequence was, that before he had
      quite reached the depot he saw the cars going out at the other end. He ran
      as fast as possible, hoping still to make up for lost time, but it was in
      vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're too late, youngster," said a porter, who had been assisting to
      stow away baggage. "You'll have to wait till the next train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When does the next train start?" asked our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twelve o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall have to wait till that time," Herbert concluded, with
      regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, as he directly afterwards thought, it could make no particular
      difference, since he had no stated engagement to meet, and this
      consideration enabled him to bear the inevitable delay with a better
      grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose," he reflected, "I might as well go back to the hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to leave the building when a carriage drove hastily up to the
      station. It was drawn by two horses, and driven by a negro in livery. A
      lady put her head out of the window and inquired anxiously if the train
      had started. She addressed this question to Herbert, who happened to be
      nearest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam," he answered, respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so sorry," said the lady, in a tone of vexation and perplexity. "It
      was very important that my father should take that train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is another train that starts at twelve," said Herbert. "It will
      make a difference of a few hours only."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the lady, "but you do not understand my difficulty. The few
      hours' difference in time would be of small importance, but my father is
      blind, and is, of course, for that reason, dependent upon the kindness of
      others. A gentleman of our acquaintance was going by this train, who would
      have taken charge of him and seen him safe to his destination. By losing
      the train we lose his services."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," said an elderly gentleman, sitting on the opposite seat, "if I
      can get somebody to see me on board, I think I can manage very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On no account, father," was the hasty reply, "particularly under present
      circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the gentleman going?" asked Herbert, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Philadelphia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going on to New York," said our hero. "I have been disappointed like
      you. I expected to take the early train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you intend to go by the next train, then?" asked the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, perhaps&mdash;I have a great mind to ask you to take charge of my
      father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be very glad to be of service to you," said Herbert. "There is
      only one objection," he added, with some embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said Herbert, frankly, "I am obliged to be economical, and I was
      thinking of buying a second-class ticket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said the lady, promptly, "there need be no difficulty about that. If
      you will take the trouble to look after my father, we will gladly pay for
      your ticket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid my services will not be worth so much," said Herbert,
      modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must leave us to estimate them. If you do what you have undertaken,
      we shall consider the expense well incurred."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert made no further objection. He felt, indeed, that it would be quite
      a lift to him, in the present state of his finances, and besides would be
      a very easy way of earning the money. He therefore signified his thanks
      and his acceptance of the offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did you say the train starts?" asked the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At twelve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly five hours. That will be too long to wait. I think, father, we
      will go home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear, I think that will be best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you obliged to go home before starting?" the lady inquired,
      addressing Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam, I have no home in Columbus. I passed last night at a hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any particular plan for spending the next few hours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert answered in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then will you not ride home with us? You will then be ready to start with
      my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be happy to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that will be much the best plan. Pompey, open the carriage door
      for the young gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hero was about to say that he could just as well open the door for
      himself, but he reflected that it was best to adapt himself to the customs
      of those he was with. He bowed, therefore, and waited till the coachman
      had opened the door for him, and stepped into the carriage. The lady
      signed to him to take a seat beside her, and the door was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Home, Pompey," said she, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman ascended to his seat, and the spirited grays were soon
      whirling the party rapidly homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new position for our hero, and he felt it to be so. His parents
      had never been rich, and latterly had been very poor. Living in a small
      country village, he had never even seen so elegant a carriage as that in
      which he was now riding He sank back upon the luxuriously cushioned seat,
      and he could not help thinking how pleasant it would be if he could
      command so comfortable a conveyance whenever he wanted to ride out. But
      another thought succeeded this. If he were blind, like the gentleman whom
      he was to take charge of, it would be a very poor compensation to ride in
      a luxurious carriage. After all, things were not so unequal as they seemed
      at first sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you are to be my father's traveling companion," said the lady,
      "perhaps you will not object to telling us your name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said our hero, "my name is Herbert Mason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going from home for the first time?" inquired the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no home," said Herbert. "My father and mother are both dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me," said the lady, gently. "I am sorry to have touched upon a
      subject which must awaken sorrowful recollections. My father's name is
      Carroll. Father, you have heard that your young escort is Mr. Herbert
      Mason."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman extended his hand, which Herbert took respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid you will find me a troublesome charge," he said. "Since I
      have become blind I have been compelled to tax the kindness of others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The journey will be pleasanter to me," said Herbert, politely, "than if I
      were alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carroll was evidently pleased with this remark, for he turned toward
      Herbert with increased interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can imagine how much more so it will be to me," he said. "I have not
      your resources for beguiling the tedium of the way. I would give all my
      possessions gladly, for your young eyes. All journeys are alike to me now,
      since, however interesting the scenery, it is a blank to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is indeed a privation, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Especially in the journey we are about to take. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio
      Railroad, as it is called, runs through a romantic and charming country,
      and affords views at once bold and beautiful. Have you ever traveled over
      the road?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will have all the pleasure of a first discovery. Before I became
      blind, before, indeed, the railway was located, I became, as a young man,
      familiar with this whole section of country, so that I have, at least, the
      remembrance of it. I am obliged now to live upon my memory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say you have never been over this railroad," said the lady. "Have you
      ever been to the East?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam, I have always lived in the State of Ohio."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are now going to Philadelphia?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to New York," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! Is it on a visit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam, I am expecting to live there; that is, if I can make a
      living."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you dependent, then, upon your own exertions for support?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem very young for such a responsibility."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am fourteen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you a year older. My Oscar is fourteen, and I am afraid he
      would make a poor hand at supporting himself. What do you think, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you are right, my dear. Oscar has not been placed in
      circumstances to develop his self-reliance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; that probably has something to do with it. But, Herbert, if you will
      permit me to call you so, do you not look forward to the future with
      apprehension?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam," said Herbert. "I am not afraid but that I shall be able to
      get along somehow. I think I shall find friends, and I am willing to
      work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the spirit that leads to success," said the old gentleman,
      approvingly. "Work comes to willing hands. I think you will succeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hero was gratified to meet with so much sympathy from those whose
      wealth placed them far above him in the social scale. But it was not
      surprising, for Herbert had a fine appearance and gentlemanly manners,
      marked, too, by a natural politeness which enabled him to appear better
      than most boys of his age.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A YOUNG ARISTOCRAT
    </h3>
    <p>
      After a drive of three miles, which was accomplished in a short time by
      the spirited horses, the carriage entered, through an ornamental gate,
      upon a smooth driveway, which led up to a handsome mansion, of large size,
      with a veranda stretching along the entire front.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boy, a little smaller than Herbert, ran out of the front door, and
      opened the door of the carriage before Pompey had time to descend from the
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, grandpa, come back?" he said, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Oscar, we were too late for the train," said his mother. "I brought
      you back a companion for a few hours. This is Herbert Mason, whom I
      intrust to your care, depending upon you to see that he passes his time
      pleasantly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oscar looked at Herbert inquisitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert offered his hand, saying, "I am glad to make your acquaintance,
      Oscar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long are you going to stay?" asked Oscar, as his mother and
      grandfather went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must return in time to take the twelve o'clock train."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is grandpa going, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you going to take care of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't want to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's an awful bore to be tied to a blind man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd find it more of a bore to be blind yourself," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I suppose I should. Grandpa wants me to go to walk with him
      sometimes, but I don't like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I had a grandfather who was blind, I think I should be willing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait till you have one, and you'll see how it is then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose he needs somebody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, he can take one of the servants, then. It's their business to
      work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you live?" he asked, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to live in New York."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you? I should like to go there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you wouldn't want to go as I am going."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, alone? Yes, I should rather go that way. Then I could do as I
      pleased. Now it's 'Oscar, do this,' and 'You mustn't do that,' all the
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That isn't what I mean exactly. I've got to earn my own living after I
      get there, and I don't know anybody in the city."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't run away from home, have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't got any home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's your father and mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are both dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope to get into a store or counting-room and learn to be a merchant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shan't have to work for a living," said Oscar, in a tone of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because your family is rich, I suppose," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we've got a large estate, ever so many acres. That's what mother's
      got. Then grandpa is rich besides, and I expect he will leave me a good
      deal of his money. He's pretty old, and I don't believe he'll live very
      long."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oscar said this with such evident satisfaction that Herbert was disgusted,
      thinking it not very creditable to him to speculate so complacently upon
      his grandfather's speedy death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to be well off, then," said he, at last, to the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Oscar, "our family is one of the first in the State. My father
      is a Peyton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he?" asked Herbert, not appearing as much awestruck as Oscar expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got a plantation in Virginia. We live there part of the year. My
      father's there now. I hope we shall go there soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you like it better than here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a good deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a handsome place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, this is mother's estate. The other belongs to father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any brothers and sisters, Oscar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got one sister. She's about twelve. But, I say, I thought you were a
      gentleman's son when I first saw you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I am," said Herbert, emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was your father rich?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he have to work for a living?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he wasn't a gentleman," said Oscar, decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't anybody a gentleman that has to work for a living?" asked Herbert,
      his indignation excited by his companion's assumption of superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not," said Oscar, coolly. "It isn't respectable to work.
      Niggers and servants work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is where I don't agree with you," said Herbert, his face flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't pretend to be a gentleman, do you?" demanded Oscar, insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do," said Herbert, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you're not one, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know anything of the kind," said Herbert, angrily. "I suppose you
      call yourself one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I am a gentleman," said Oscar, complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't talk like one, at any rate," retorted Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was new language for Oscar to hear. He had been accustomed to have
      his own way pretty much, and had been used to order round his father's
      servants and slaves like a little despot. The idea of being told by a boy
      who had to work for a living that he did not talk like a gentleman, did
      not suit him at all. His black eyes flashed and he clenched his fists.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to insult me?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never insult anybody," said Herbert, not feeling particularly alarmed
      by this hostile demonstration. "It is you that have insulted me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you tell me I was not a gentleman?" said Oscar, hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said you did not talk like one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's about the same thing," said Oscar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as you like. Even if I did say so, you said the same of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, suppose I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am as much a gentleman as you, to say the least," asserted Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you say that again, I'll knock you down," said Oscar, furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll say it all day, if I like," said Herbert, defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it would have been better for Herbert to stop disputing, and to
      have taken no notice of Oscar's words. But Herbert was not perfect. He had
      plenty of spirit, and he was provoked by the airs Oscar chose to assume,
      and by no means inclined to allow him to arrogate a superiority over
      himself, merely on account of his wealth. Though manly and generous, he
      was quick to resent an insult, and accordingly, when Oscar dared to repeat
      what he had said, he instantly accepted the challenge as recorded above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Oscar been prudent, he would have hesitated before endeavoring to
      carry his threat into execution. A moment's glance at the two boys would
      have satisfied anyone that the chances, in a personal contest, were
      decidedly in our hero's favor. Herbert was not only a little taller than
      Oscar, perhaps an inch and a half, but his shoulders were broader and his
      frame more muscular. Oscar had never done any work to strengthen his arms,
      while Herbert had been forced by circumstances to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oscar flung himself upon Herbert, and endeavored to bear him to the
      ground. But the latter, without an effort, repelled the charge, and flung
      himself free from his antagonist's grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      This naturally made Oscar more determined to overcome his foe. His face
      red with passion, he showered blows upon Herbert, which the latter parried
      with ease. At first he acted wholly upon the defensive, but, finding that
      Oscar's impetuosity did not abate, suddenly closed with him and threw him
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oscar rose but little hurt, for Herbert used no unnecessary force, and
      recommenced the assault. But the result was the same as before. Oscar was
      almost beside himself with mingled rage and mortification, and it is hard
      to tell how long the contest would have lasted, had not a servant come up
      and informed the boys that Mrs. Peyton wished to see them immediately. She
      had witnessed the whole scene from a window and felt called upon to
      interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is this, young gentleman?" she asked, gravely. "You have scarcely
      been together twenty minutes, and I find you fighting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, Mrs. Peyton," said Herbert, in a manly tone. "I feel
      ashamed of myself, but Oscar attacked me for claiming to be a gentleman,
      and I am afraid that my blood was up, and so we got into a fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is this, Oscar?" said his mother. "Did you so wholly lose your
      politeness as to attack your guest for asserting his claims to be a
      gentleman? I am annoyed with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says he has to work for a living," said Oscar, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So may you, some time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am rich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may not always be. At any rate, being rich doesn't insure gentlemanly
      behavior, as your conduct to-day clearly shows. Herbert, I hope you will
      excuse my son's rudeness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is my hand, Oscar," said Herbert, cordially. "Let us be friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oscar hardly knew how to receive this overture, but he was finally thawed
      by Herbert's manner, and they were soon sauntering about on the lawn on
      the best of terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past eleven, after an inviting lunch, the carriage was ordered,
      and Herbert and Mr. Carroll were driven to the depot, accompanied by
      Oscar, who went in his mother's place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert purchased tickets for both, being intrusted with Mr. Carrol's
      pocketbook for that purpose. He found a comfortable seat for the old
      gentleman, and sat down beside him.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER
    </h3>
    <p>
      I pass over the route pursued by the travelers from Columbus to Wheeling,
      in West Virginia, as it possesses no special interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after leaving Wheeling there is quite a change. Those of my readers
      who are familiar with the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railway will be able to
      understand the enjoyment which Herbert derived from the bold and romantic
      scenery visible from the car windows. Mr. Carroll made him take the seat
      nearest the window, that he might have a better view, and from time to
      time Herbert described what he saw to his sightless fellow-traveler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Northwestern Virginia is very mountainous and the construction of a
      railway through such a region was a triumph of engineering skill. At times
      the road makes bold curves, so that the traveler, looking from the car
      window, can see opposite him, across an intervening gulf, the track over
      which the train was passing five minutes before. At some places the track
      is laid on a narrow shelf, midway of the mountain, a steep and rugged
      ascent on one side, a deep ravine on the other, somewhat like the old
      diligence road over the Alpine Mt. Cenis. Here and there appear small
      hamlets, consisting of one-story cabins, with the chimney built alongside,
      instead of rising from the roof in the usual manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long shall we be in reaching Baltimore, Mr. Carroll? "asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe it takes about twenty-six hours," said the old gentleman. "But
      I do not mean to go through without stopping."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know what your plan was," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been meaning to tell you. Our tickets will allow us to stop
      anywhere, and resume our journey the next morning, or even stop two or
      three days, if we like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is convenient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. If it had been otherwise, I should have purchased the ticket
      piecemeal. I cannot endure to travel all night. It fatigues me too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where shall we stop, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not yet quite made up my mind. We will ride till about eight
      o'clock, and then stop over at whatever place we chance to have reached."
    </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement struck Herbert favorably. He was in no particular hurry,
      and the scenery was so fine, that he feared that he should lose a great
      deal by traveling at night, when, of course, he could not see anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat for a while in silence. Then Mr. Carroll inquired, suddenly, "Did
      you ever fire a pistol, Herbert?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," was the surprised reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you understand how to use one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, sir. There was a young man in Waverley, the town where I used to
      live, who owned one, and I sometimes borrowed it to fire at a mark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I think I will intrust this weapon to your charge," said the old
      gentleman, drawing from his pocket a handsome pistol, and placing it in
      Herbert's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it loaded, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not at present. We will have it loaded before going to bed. I will
      tell you," he added, in a lower tone, "my reason for going armed. It so
      happens that I have a large amount of money with me, and, of course, I
      feel a little concerned about its safety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it will be well not to say anything more about it at present,
      sir," suggested Herbert, in a low voice. "You may be heard by someone who
      would like to take advantage of his discovery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt you are right. I will follow your advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert would not have thought to give this caution, but, just as Mr.
      Carroll uttered the words, "I have a large sum of money with me," a man
      dressed in a rough frieze coat, with black whiskers, and a general
      appearance, which, to say the least, did not prepossess Herbert in his
      favor, chanced to walk through the car. Whether he caught the words
      Herbert could not tell, but he paused a moment, and fixed an unpleasant
      eye upon the two, as if determined to know them when he should meet them
      again. There was another suspicious circumstance. It had evidently been
      his intention to pass through the car, but he paused abruptly, and,
      turning back, sank into an unoccupied seat a few feet back of that
      occupied by Mr. Carroll and his young companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      His attention naturally drawn by this suspicious conduct, Herbert was
      impelled to glance back once or twice. Each time he met the watchful look
      of the man fixed upon them, instead of being directed at the scenery
      outside, as was the case with the other passengers. When he saw that the
      boy was watching him, he turned his head carelessly, and commenced
      whistling. But this apparent indifference did not deceive Herbert for a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will watch him," thought our hero. "I do not like his looks. If he
      means mischief, as I think very probable, it is necessary that I should be
      on my guard against him."
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past seven o'clock Mr. Carroll signified his intention of getting
      out at the next station. "I am beginning to feel tired," he said, "and
      shall feel the better for a good supper and a night's rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, sir," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to him that now they would get rid of the man who was watching
      them so closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he gets out of the train with us," he thought, "I shall know what it
      means."
    </p>
    <p>
      The train slackened its speed, the sound of the whistle was heard, the
      brakes were applied, and soon the conductor, putting his head in at the
      door, called out "Oakland!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here we are," said Herbert. "Give me your hand, Mr. Carroll, and I will
      lead you out."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman rose from his seat, and, guided by Herbert, walked to
      the car door. At the door Herbert turned and looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man with the black whiskers, who a moment before seemed absorbed in a
      newspaper, had left his seat, and was but a few feet behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did not believe that this was an accident. He felt sure that it
      meant mischief. But he did not on that account feel nervous, or regret
      that he had assumed a charge which seemed likely to expose him to peril.
      He had the pistol in his pocket, and that he knew would make him even with
      the rascal who was following them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a covered carriage waiting outside to convey passengers to the
      only hotel which the village afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we take the carriage, Mr. Carroll?" asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert assisted him in, and placed himself in a seat opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two or three other passengers, but the man with the black
      whiskers was not to be seen among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may be mistaken," thought Herbert, who had rather expected to see him.
      "Perhaps he lives here, and I have been alarming myself without reason.
      Still, it is always best to be on one's guard."
    </p>
    <p>
      A ride of half a mile brought them to a small but comfortable-looking inn.
      Herbert assisted Mr. Carroll to descend, and together they entered the
      house of entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall want some supper. Herbert," said Mr. Carroll. "You may order
      some."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall I order, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like some tea and toast and some beef-steak. If there is
      anything that you would prefer, you may order that also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, I should not wish anything better than you have ordered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell them to get it ready as soon as possible. I feel weary with my day's
      ride, and shall retire early."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel tired, too." thought Herbert, "but it won't do for me to sleep. I
      must keep my eyes open, if possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper was soon served. The toast was well browned, and spread with
      excellent butter. The steak was juicy and tender, contrary to the usual
      custom of country inns, and the tea was fragrant and strong. Both the
      travelers partook heartily, having eaten nothing since noon, with the
      exception of a little fruit purchased from the car window at one of the
      stations. Herbert was not usually in the habit of drinking tea at night,
      but on this particular occasion he wanted to keep awake, and therefore
      drank two cups, of undiminished strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Herbert," said Mr. Carroll, when they had finished supper, "you may
      ask the clerk to assign me to a large room with a couple of beds in it. I
      should prefer to have you in the same room with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from the table, and went to the public room, one portion of which
      was occupied by the office. As he made his way to the desk, he observed
      the man with black whiskers on a settee at one end of the room. He was
      smoking a clay pipe. Herbert caught a stealthy glance directed towards
      himself, but that was all. The man continued smoking, fixing his eyes with
      apparent interest on a large yellow handbill pasted on the opposite wall,
      announcing a performance by "The Great American Circus Company" the
      succeeding evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert succeeded in obtaining such a room as he sought, and accompanied
      by a servant bearing a lamp, went back to the dining-room to accompany Mr.
      Carroll to it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FACING A BURGLAR
    </h3>
    <p>
      Herbert deliberated as to whether it would be best to inform his aged
      traveling companion of the suspicious-looking man, who appeared to have
      followed them for no good purpose. He finally decided not to do so, since
      it would only alarm Mr. Carroll, and prevent his sleeping off his fatigue,
      while there would be no advantage gained, since a blind and feeble man
      could be of little use in repelling the burglar, should the stranger prove
      to be such.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bedroom was large and square, and contained two beds. The larger of
      these was placed in the corner, and this was assigned to the old
      gentleman. The smaller was situated between the two side windows, and was,
      of course, the more exposed of the two. This Herbert was to occupy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know how to load the pistol, Herbert?" asked Mr. Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said Herbert, confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't anticipate any occasion for using it," continued the old
      gentleman. "Still, it will be best to be prepared."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I think, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't be afraid to use it, if it should be necessary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carroll took a package from his carpet-bag and showed it to Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This package," he said, "contains five thousand dollars in bank bills. If
      it were known that I had it, I should be in danger. I suppose it will be
      best to put it back in the carpet-bag."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were mine," said Herbert, "I would not do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where, then, would you put it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would put it between the mattresses. If anyone should get into the
      room, they would seize the carpet-bag first, and, perhaps, make off before
      they could be stopped."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know but you are right," said Mr. Carroll. "Perhaps it will be
      well to put my watch in the same place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; I think it would be well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Herbert," continued the old gentleman, "how much confidence I
      repose in you. Knowing where my watch and money are, it would be very easy
      for you to secure both, and leave me here, destitute and helpless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you don't think there is any danger of my doing so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the old gentleman. "Though our acquaintance is so recent, I
      feel great confidence in you. As I cannot see the face, I have learned to
      judge of the character by the tone of the voice, and I am very much
      mistaken if you are not thoroughly honest and trustworthy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir," said Herbert, his face flushed with pleasure at this
      evidently sincere commendation. "You shall not repent your confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure of that, Herbert," said Mr. Carroll, kindly. "But I must bid
      you good-night. This has been a fatiguing day, and I shall lose no time in
      getting to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night. I hope you will sleep well, sir," said Herbert. "There won't
      be much sleep for me," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carroll lay down, and his deep, tranquil breathing soon assured our
      hero that he was asleep. He rose from his bed and examined the windows.
      All but one were provided with fastenings. But the one on the right-hand
      side of his bed could be raised from the outside without difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I had a nail," thought Herbert. "I could soon make it fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was none in the room, and he did not wish to go downstairs for
      one, since he would probably meet the stranger, who would then learn what
      precautions he was taking, and so, perhaps, vary his attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That window will need watching," thought Herbert. "I wonder whether I
      shall be able to keep awake."
    </p>
    <p>
      The excitement of his situation, and, perhaps, the strong tea, to which he
      was unaccustomed, helped him to remain vigilant. His mind was active and
      on the alert, and his ears were open to catch the least sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only half-past ten. Probably the attempt to enter the room would
      not be made before twelve, at least, in order to insure their being
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert examined his pistol. It was in excellent order, and was provided
      with two barrels, both of which he loaded. Thus, he would have a double
      chance to defend himself. He did not remove all his clothing, but kept on
      his pants, in order to be prepared for emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an hour and a half to wait before midnight. The minutes passed
      slowly. Herbert for a time heard the murmur of voices in the barroom
      below, then steps ascended the stairs, and, after a while, all was hushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish the fellow would come quick," he thought, "if he is coming at all,
      so that it might be all over, and I might go to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      Time sped on. Herbert could hear the village clock striking twelve; but
      still all around remained quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been a half an hour later when he heard a slight noise, as
      he thought, under the window. Jumping softly out of bed, he took a peep
      out. It was just light enough for him to distinguish a dark form moving
      about, bearing something, which he soon perceived to be a ladder. That it
      was the black-whiskered man who had followed them, he did not doubt, and
      he felt confident that he intended to place the ladder against the window.
      He was not mistaken. He heard the top of the ladder softly inclined
      against the house, and then he felt that the critical moment, which was to
      test his courage, was close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert's heart began to beat rapidly. He felt that he was taking upon
      himself a fearful responsibility in shooting this man, as he would
      probably be obliged to do in self-defense. But one thing he resolved upon.
      He would not take his life. He would only use such a degree of violence as
      should be absolutely necessary. He would even give him a chance by firing
      the first barrel in the air, in hope of frightening the robber. If that
      failed, he must wound him. There was little time for these thoughts to
      pass through his mind, for all the while the man was creeping up the
      ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert had moved a little aside, that he might not be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon he perceived, by the indistinct light, the face of the stranger
      rising above the window-sill. Next, the window was slowly raised, and he
      began to make preparations to enter the room. Then Herbert felt that it
      was time for him to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping intrepidly to the window, he said: "I know your purpose. Unless
      you go down instantly, I will shoot you."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no tremor in his voice as he said this. Courage came with the
      occasion, and his tone was resolute, and self-possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you're awake, are you, my chicken?" was the reply. "If you know what's
      best for yourself, you'll hand over the old man's money, and save me the
      trouble of getting in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" said Herbert, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will take it myself, and give you something to remember me by, you
      little fool!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He placed his knee on the window-sill, and prepared to jump in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One step farther," said Herbert, resolutely, "and I fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He displayed the pistol, at the sight of which the burglar hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on a bit," said he, pausing. "I'll give you some of the plunder, if
      you'll put up that shooting iron, and make no trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think me a villain, like yourself?" asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By &mdash;&mdash;, you shall repent this," said the robber, with an oath,
      and he made another attempt to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sharp report, but Herbert had fired in the air, and the
      burglar was unhurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confusion!" he exclaimed; "that will raise the house!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, espying the carpet-bag, he determined to jump in, seize it, and get
      away before the people in the house were fairly awake. As for the pistol,
      that had been discharged, and he supposed that nothing was to be feared
      from it. But he reckoned without his host. As he put one leg over, and had
      all but succeeded in getting in, Herbert fired once more, this time
      hitting him in the shoulder. He uttered a shriek of pain, and, losing his
      hold, tumbled backward to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two reports alarmed the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" exclaimed Mr. Carroll, awakened and alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be alarmed, sir," said Herbert. "A man just attempted to get in
      through the window, and I have wounded him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a brave boy," said Mr. Carroll. "Where is he now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has tumbled to the ground, shot through the shoulder, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a loud thumping at the door. Herbert opened it, and admitted
      half a dozen guests, headed by the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" exclaimed all, in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will come to the window, gentlemen, I will show you," said
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed him curiously, and the sight of the ladder and the wounded
      man, who was uttering groans of pain from the ground below, told the story
      at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Served the rascal right," said the landlord. "Who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The black-whiskered man who was in the barroom last night," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember now; he asked particularly where you were to sleep&mdash;you
      and the old gentleman&mdash;but I did not suspect his purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did," said Herbert, "and kept awake to be ready for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a brave lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only did my duty," said Herbert, modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help! help!" groaned the wretch below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert heard the cry of pain, and his heart was filled with pity. The man
      was, indeed, a villain. He had only been served right, as the landlord
      said. Still, he was a fellow-creature, and he was in pain. Herbert could
      not regret that he had shot him; but he did regret the necessity, and he
      felt sympathy for him in his suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor fellow!" he said, compassionately; "I am afraid he is a good deal
      hurt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor fellow!" echoed the landlord. "It serves him right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, he is in pain, and he ought to be cared for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has no claim upon us. He may be there till morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Mr. Carroll. "Herbert is right. He is guilty, but he is in
      pain, and it is the part of humanity to succor him. Landlord, if you will
      have him brought in, and send for the doctor, you may look to me for your
      pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, he was going to rob you, sir," said the landlord, considerably
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that is true; but you don't know how strongly he was tempted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks like a hard ticket. I didn't like to give him a bed, but we
      can't well refuse travelers, if they have money to pay their reckoning. I
      made him pay in advance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, lose no time," said Herbert, as another groan was heard; "I will go
      out and help you bring him in."
    </p>
    <p>
      A lantern was lit, and the whole company followed the landlord out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, throwing the light of the candle full on the sufferer's
      face, "you've got yourself into a fine pickle, haven't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," groaned the burglar, "if it hadn't been for that accursed boy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd have got off with the old gentleman's money. Well, it was rather
      unkind to interfere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you in much pain?" asked Herbert, bending over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in his voice that betrayed the compassion he really
      felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burglar looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're the boy that wounded me, ain't you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curse you! I don't know but you've killed me. I'm shot through the
      shoulder. Then, that cursed fall! I feel as if I had broken my back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not want to shoot you," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do it for, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you forced me to it. You were after Mr. Carroll's money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't I offer to divide with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but, of course, I would not agree to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you so much better than common folks?" sneered the burglar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know about that. I would not steal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take him up," said the landlord to the hotel servants. "He don't deserve
      it, but I've promised the old gentleman we'd see to him. Tom White, you
      may go for the doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men approached and attempted to lift the wounded burglar. But, in the
      first attempt, they touched the injured shoulder. He uttered a shriek of
      pain, and exclaimed, "You'll murder me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me lift him," said Herbert. "Perhaps you were too rough."
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, but not without much groaning on the part of the burglar, he
      was got into the house, and laid on a bed in a small room on the first
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you feel better?" asked Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think you have broken any bones in falling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so at first, but perhaps I am only bruised."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the doctor comes, he will extract the bullet, and relieve you of a
      good deal of your pain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a strange boy," said the burglar, with a look of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why am I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shot me, and yet you pretend to be sorry for me now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, why did you shoot me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already told you. Because I was obliged to. I would not have done
      it, if there had been any other way. I shot the first barrel in the air."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By accident?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I thought it would alarm you, and I might save the money without
      injuring you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really mean that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you don't have any ill-will against me now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is strange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know why it should be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I ought to hate you, because you have brought me to this pass,"
      said the burglar, thoughtfully, "but I don't. That is strange, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so glad you feel so," said Herbert. "I am very sorry for your pain,
      and I will do what I can to relieve it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no money to pay the landlord and the doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Carroll says he will pay all needed expenses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man I wanted to rob?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then hang me, if I ain't ashamed of trying to rob him," said the burglar,
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever robbed anyone before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I haven't. I'm a rough customer, and have done plenty of mean things,
      but this is the first job of the kind I ever attempted. I wouldn't have
      done it, only I heard the old man say in the cars, that he had a lot of
      money with him. I was hard up, and on my way to Cedarville, to try to get
      work, but when I heard what he said, the devil tempted me, I believe, and
      I determined to keep you both in sight, and get out where you did. I've
      tried and failed, and that's the end of it. It's my first attempt at
      burglary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it will be the last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may bet your life on that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said Herbert, quietly, "I will intercede with Mr. Carroll for you,
      and ask him not to have you arrested."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you do that?" asked the wounded man, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promise it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will, boy, I will bless you, and if God would listen to such a
      scamp as I am, I'd pray for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will listen to you," said Herbert. "Try to lead a better life, and He
      will help you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I'd met with such as you before," said the burglar. "I'd have been
      a better man than I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the doctor entered, and Herbert gave place to him. The wound was
      discovered not to be serious, and, the bullet being extracted, the
      sufferer found relief. Herbert returned to bed, and this time, having no
      anxious thoughts to weigh upon his mind, he soon sank into a refreshing
      sleep, in which the fatigues and excitements of the day were completely
      forgotten.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HERBERT'S REWARD
    </h3>
    <p>
      "I owe the safety of my money to you, my brave boy," said Mr. Carroll, the
      next morning, as, after rising, he replaced the package of bank notes in
      his carpet-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only did my duty," said Herbert, but his face flushed with pleasure at
      the commendations bestowed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But in doing your duty, you displayed a courage and fidelity rare in one
      of your age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad you approve of my conduct," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you continue to deserve as well of those who employ you, I am sure you
      will achieve success."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so, sir," said our hero. "I shall try to do my duty in whatever
      situation in life I may be placed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are your plans when you reach New York?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall try to find a place in a store, or counting-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you friends in the city on whose influence you can rely to help you
      to such a situation as you desire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; I have only myself to look to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only yourself! It is a bold undertaking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think I shall succeed?" asked Herbert, a little anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not doubt that you will succeed, after finding a place, but that is
      the difficulty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I supposed there must be plenty to do in a great city like New York."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is truth in what you say, but, nevertheless, many are led astray by
      it. There is, indeed, a great deal to do, but there are a great many ready
      to do it, and generally&mdash;I may say, always&mdash;the laborers exceed
      the work to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," said Herbert, "many fail to get work, because they are
      particular what they do. If I can find nothing better to do, I will black
      boots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With such a spirit, I think you will succeed. But, perhaps, I can smooth
      away some of the difficulties in your path. I know a firm in New York&mdash;connections
      of our family&mdash;to whom I will give you a letter of introduction. If
      they have no room for you in their house, they may influence someone else
      to take you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall feel very much obliged to you for such a letter. It will do me a
      great deal of good," said Herbert, gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will gladly write it, but now let us go down to breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast was over, they looked in upon the wounded man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you feel this morning?" asked Herbert, going up to the bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather stiff, but I am not in such pain as I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to hear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the gentleman I was going to rob?" said the burglar, looking in
      the direction of Mr. Carroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he&mdash;did you say anything to him about not prosecuting me?" he
      asked, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be under no apprehension," said Mr. Carroll, mildly. "I do not care to
      punish you more than you have already been punished. I prefer that you
      should lead a better life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will try to do so, sir; but I was poor, and that made the temptation
      stronger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can easily believe it. Are you wholly without means?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, then, is a purse containing a hundred dollars. It will probably pay
      your expenses during your illness."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wounded man looked up in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There ain't many that would pay a man for trying to rob them," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not pay you for that," said Mr. Carroll, "but because I do not wish
      you to be subjected to a similar temptation again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wounded man, who, under different treatment would have been defiant
      and profane, seemed quite subdued by such unexpected kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir," he said, "all I can say is, that I am very much obliged to
      you, and I hope you will be rewarded for your kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is easier to lead men than to drive them," said Mr. Carroll, as they
      left the chamber. "This man is rough, and not troubled much with a
      conscience, but harshness would make him still worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said Herbert; "I think you are right."
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast they resumed their journey. In due time they reached
      Baltimore, and remained over night at a hotel. In the course of the
      succeeding day they arrived at Philadelphia, which was the termination of
      Mr. Carroll's journey. As the country through which they passed was
      unknown to Herbert, the journey was full of interest, but there was no
      adventure worth recording.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time came when the two travelers were compelled to part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were going to a hotel, Herbert," said Mr. Carroll, "I would invite
      you to remain with me a day or two; but I shall proceed at once to the
      house of a friend, and I shall not feel at liberty to invite you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir," said Herbert. "I think it will be best for me to go on
      to New York at once. I have got my living to make, and I am anxious to get
      to work as soon as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a praiseworthy feeling," said the old gentleman. "Life lies before
      you. I have left nearly the whole of it behind me. I am drawing near the
      end of my journey. You are just at the beginning. I shall hope to meet you
      again, but, if not, be assured that I shall always remember, with
      pleasure, my young traveling companion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not soon forget the essential service which you have rendered
      me," continued the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think of it, sir," said Herbert, modestly, "Anyone would have done
      the same thing in my place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am by no means sure of that. At any rate, the obligation remains. You
      must allow me to acknowledge it in some measure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carroll drew out his pocketbook and handed it to Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you oblige me," he said, "by counting the bills in this pocketbook?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are sixty-five dollars," he said, passing it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you take out fifty dollars?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir&mdash;I have done it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the sum you will oblige me by keeping," said Mr. Carroll. "I hope
      it may be of service to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You give me so much money?" said Herbert, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is but a very small sum, compared with that which you have saved me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I ought to take so much," said Herbert, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need not hesitate, my young friend. I am blessed with abundant means,
      and very well able to part with it. Besides, it is only one per cent. of
      the money which you have been instrumental in saving me, and you are
      certainly entitled to as much as that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you very much for the gift, Mr. Carroll," said our hero, "and
      still more for the kind manner in which you give it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You accept it, then? That is well," said the old gentleman, with
      satisfaction. "There is one thing more. You remember that I spoke to you
      of a business firm in Pearl Street, New York, with the members of which I
      am acquainted. Last evening I prepared a letter of introduction to them
      for you. Here it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir," said Herbert. "I was very fortunate in meeting with one
      so able and willing to assist me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very welcome to all the help I am able to give you. I shall be
      very glad if your life shall be as prosperous as mine has been. I must
      trouble you to do me one more service. If you will find me a cab, I will
      go at once to my friend's house."
    </p>
    <p>
      No difficulty was experienced in obtaining a carriage. There was a cordial
      leave-taking, and Herbert once more found himself alone. But with rather
      more than sixty dollars in his pocket, he felt rich, and looked forward
      eagerly to his arrival in the great city, where he hoped to deserve and
      win success.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ROBBED IN THE NIGHT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Herbert entered the cars, and took a seat by the window. His small bundle,
      containing all the extra clothing he had been able to bring away from the
      inhospitable home of Mr. Holden, he placed in the seat beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was yet early, and there were but few persons in the car. But as the
      hour for starting approached, it gradually filled up. Still, the seat next
      to Herbert remained untaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length a young man, apparently about nineteen, walked up the aisle,
      and, pausing, inquired, "Is this seat engaged?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Herbert, at the same time removing his bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, if you have no objection, I'll take possession."
    </p>
    <p>
      He accordingly seated himself, and commenced a conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going to New York?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you live there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I have never been there before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going on a visit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I am going to live there; that is, if I can find anything to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I. Suppose we hitch teams."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose we go to some hotel together. I have been there before, and can
      tell you where to go. It's awful dull being alone. I always like to pick
      up company."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert hardly knew what to say to this proposition. He did not exactly
      like the appearance, or fancy the free and easy manners of his new
      acquaintance, but he felt lonely, and, besides, he hardly knew what excuse
      to make. He, therefore, gave his assent to the arrangement proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your name?" asked his new friend, familiarly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert Mason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine is Greenleaf&mdash;Peter Greenleaf. Have you come from a distance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Waverley, in Ohio, not far from Cincinnati."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am from Philadelphia. I've been in a store there, but I didn't like the
      style, and I concluded to go to New York. There's more chance for a fellow
      of enterprise there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of a store were you in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dry-goods store&mdash;Hatch &amp; Macy. Old Hatch is a mean skinflint,
      and wouldn't pay me half what I was worth. I don't want to brag, but there
      wasn't a man in that store that sold as much as I did. And how much do you
      think I got?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only seven dollars a week. If I hadn't made something another way. I
      couldn't have paid my expenses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think you might live on seven dollars a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was before the war had increased the expenses of living.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't do it. Board cost me four dollars a week, and that only left
      three for other expenses. My cigars cost me nearly that. Then I wanted to
      go to the theater now and then, and, of course, I must dress like a
      gentleman. I tell you what, seven dollars a week didn't begin to do me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you manage, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I made so much more by banking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By banking?" repeated Herbert, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; only it was a faro bank. I used to pick up considerable that way,
      sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A faro bank!" repeated Herbert, in dismay. "Why, that's the same as
      gambling, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what's the odds? You take your chance, and you may win or lose.
      It's a pretty fair thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      After this confession, Herbert became more than ever doubtful whether he
      should care to remain long in the company of his present companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the cars were moving rapidly. Peter Greenleaf, as he called
      himself, talked volubly, and appeared to have a considerable familiarity
      with certain phases of life, the knowledge of which was not likely to have
      been very profitable to him. Still, Herbert was interested in his
      communications, though the opinion which he formed of him was far from
      favorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going to stop when you get to New York?" inquired Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know anything about the city. I suppose I shall have to go to a
      hotel first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose we go to French's Hotel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Near the park. It's on the European plan. You pay fifty cents a day for
      your rooms, and whatever you please for your meals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I shall like that. I shall want to get into a boarding-house as
      soon as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. We'll take a room together at the hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement was not to Herbert's taste, but he did not care to offend
      his companion by objecting to it, so by his silence, he gave consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do in New York?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall look up a situation. I won't take less than fifteen dollars a
      week. A man of my experience ought to be worth that. Don't you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Herbert, dubiously, though it occurred to him that if he were
      an employer, he would not be likely to engage such a clerk at any price.
      But it is rather fortunate, all things considered, that we are able to
      keep our thoughts to ourselves, otherwise, the complacency of our
      companions, and sometimes our own, would run the risk of being rudely
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In course of time the terminus of the road was reached, and, crossing over
      from Jersey City, Herbert found himself, for the first time in his life,
      in the noise and whirl of the great city.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I am actually to live here," thought Herbert. "I wonder what Mr.
      Holden would say if he knew where I was?" Uncertain as his prospects were,
      he felt very glad that he was out of the clutches of the petty despot,
      whose chief pleasure was to make him uncomfortable. Here, at least, the
      future was full of possibilities of good fortune; there, it was certain
      discomfort and little to hope for.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the hotel you spoke of?" he asked, turning to Greenleaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll lead you to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked up to Broadway, then up by the Astor House, and across the
      park to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll go in and secure a room the first thing," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered, Greenleaf taking the lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show us a room with two beds," said Peter to the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant was summoned, and the room assigned to them was indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any baggage?" asked the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Greenleaf, carelessly. "Mine was checked through from
      Philadelphia. I shan't send for it till morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I must ask you to pay in advance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Fifty cents, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mason," said Greenleaf, "have you got a dollar about you? I've got
      nothing less than a ten."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert drew out a dollar and paid for himself and his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now shown up to a room on the third floor, which proved to be a
      very comfortable one, looking out on the street. Herbert was glad to get a
      chance to wash himself thoroughly after the dusty journey which he had
      just completed. This ceremony over, they went down to the restaurant
      connected with the hotel, and took a hearty meal. Greenleaf made an effort
      to have Herbert pay for both, but this time Herbert also had a bill to
      change. It was rather a suspicious circumstance, he thought, that
      Greenleaf, who had no bill smaller than a ten, paid for his meal out of a
      one-dollar bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper Greenleaf bought a couple of cigars, and offered Herbert one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you," said our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you smoke?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have you been living all your life? I couldn't get along without my
      cigar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think it hurtful to a boy to smoke?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know about that. I'm a man now, but I've smoked ever since I was
      a boy. I think it does a fellow good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's expensive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's so. I expect I've smoked a thousand dollars' worth of cigars
      in the course of my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you wish you had the money instead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I should rather like the money, but I shouldn't be half the man I am
      if I hadn't smoked. It's mostly milksops that don't smoke. Nothing
      personal, you know, Mason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not," said Herbert, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better have a cigar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I guess not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll come to it in time. I'll smoke it for you, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      After smoking, Greenleaf expressed his intention of going to the theater.
      Herbert preferred to go to bed early, feeling rather tired. He was kept
      awake at first by the noise of the horse-cars and the bustle of the street
      outside, as well as by the exciting thoughts that crowded upon him,
      suggested by his actual arrival in the city, where he hoped to make a
      place for himself by energy and industry. But at last he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept soundly through the night. But towards morning he had a dream in
      which Abner Holden figured. His old employer seemed to be approaching him
      with a smile of exultation, and was about to lay violent hands upon him,
      when he awoke. It was broad daylight, being already seven o'clock in the
      morning. Herbert remembered where he was, and looked across the room for
      Greenleaf. But he was not visible. The bed was disarranged, and evidently
      had been slept in, but the occupant had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't think he was a fellow to rise early," thought Herbert. "I
      suppose he is downstairs. I might as well get up, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert jumped out of bed, and, going to the wash-stand, washed his face
      and hands. He then proceeded to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder Greenleaf didn't wake me up," he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the reason was too soon made evident. Happening to put his hand in the
      pocket where he usually kept his pocketbook, he was startled at finding it
      empty. Somewhat alarmed, he began to hunt round upon the floor, thinking
      it possible that it might have dropped out. But his search was vain. It
      was not to be found. He then examined carefully the remaining pockets,
      still without success.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until this moment that a suspicion entered his mind concerning
      his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible," he thought, "that Greenleaf has been mean enough to
      strip me of my money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert did not want to believe this. He disliked to think badly of
      anyone, and he still hoped it would prove otherwise. It was barely
      possible that Greenleaf had taken his money by way of playing a practical
      joke upon him, and he might now be downstairs, waiting to be amused at
      Herbert's look of dismay when he discovered that he was penniless.
      Drowning men will catch at straws, and Herbert, in his trouble, tried to
      think this was probably the way it had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Greenleaf is rather a hard case, according to his own account," he said
      to himself, "but I can't believe he would be mean enough to rob me. I will
      go downstairs and see if I can find him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, leaving his chamber, he descended the staircase, and made his
      way to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert went up and spoke to the clerk who chanced to be inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen my roommate?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the number of your room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. &mdash;&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember now. He has gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone!" echoed Herbert, in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; didn't you know of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He went away while I was asleep. How long since did he go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He came to the office two hours since, and said he should not require the
      room any longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he leave any message for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he say where he was going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such an expression of dismay and perplexity overspread Herbert's face that
      the clerk could not help observing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is anything wrong?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Herbert. "He has robbed me of my pocketbook, containing all my
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whew!" whistled the clerk. "How much had you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About sixty dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're unlucky, that's a fact. Have you nothing left?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then it flashed across Herbert's mind that when he had paid for his
      supper he had changed a five-dollar bill, and placed the balance, about
      four dollars and a half in his vest pocket. He at once felt in that
      pocket, and found it still there. Greenleaf had contented himself with the
      pocketbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a little left," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paid for his room in advance for another day, and went down to
      breakfast.

      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A BUSINESS CALL
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was certainly a startling discovery for Herbert to make, that out of
      sixty dollars he had only four left, now that he had paid for another day
      at the hotel, and this small sum must be further diminished by the expense
      of a breakfast. Unfortunately, too, he was quite hungry, for his
      misfortune had not taken away his appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will make a good breakfast, at any rate," said Herbert,
      philosophically. "Afterwards, I will consider what to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      He ordered a substantial breakfast, which, even at the low prices of a
      dozen years ago, amounted to fifty cents, and did full justice to what was
      set before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After paying at the desk, he went outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright, sunshiny morning, and this, with the comfortable feeling
      produced by having eaten a good breakfast, gave him courage for the new
      career upon which he was about to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      While considering what he should do first, the thought of the letter given
      him by Mr. Carroll flashed upon him. He felt for it hastily, and was
      rejoiced to find that that was safe, at least. Greenleaf had not taken
      that away, fortunately.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the direction. It was addressed to
    </p>
    <p>
      "Messrs. Godfrey &amp; Lynn,
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. &mdash;&mdash; Pearl St."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not sealed, and was probably meant to be read by Herbert. At any
      rate, our hero so concluded, and opened the letter, not without curiosity
      as to what Mr. Carroll had written about him. He knew it must be
      favorable, of course, but found it even more so than he anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it is:
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR MR. GODFREY: This letter will be handed you by a young friend of
      mine, by name Herbert Mason. My acquaintance with him has been brief, but
      he has been able, by his coolness and bravery, to do me a most important
      service, having saved me from being robbed of a large sum of money while
      acting as my escort from Ohio to Philadelphia. I have talked with him
      freely about his plans, and find that he will reach New York without
      friends, and with a very small sum of money, hoping before it is gone to
      secure a place in some counting-room, where he can make an honest living.
      I feel a strong interest in his success, and am persuaded that wherever he
      is placed, he will show rare capacity and fidelity. I wish it might be in
      your power to receive him into your own counting-room. But, of course,
      that must be according to your convenience. At any rate, may I rely on you
      to act a friendly part by my young friend, and to exert your influence
      toward procuring him a position elsewhere, if you cannot employ him
      yourself? Anything that you may have it in your power to do for Herbert, I
      shall consider as a favor done to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have just left my daughter, who, with her family, is well. Sincerely,
      your friend,
    </p>
    <h3>
      JAMES CARROLL."
    </h3>
    <p>
      "That is a very kind letter," thought Herbert, gratefully. "I hope it will
      do me good."
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to call and deliver it the same forenoon. If he had not been
      robbed of nearly the whole of his small capital, he would, first, have
      gone about the city, which was entirely new to him. But, with less than
      four dollars between himself and utter destitution, he felt that he had no
      time for sight-seeing. It was necessary that he should get to work as soon
      as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited till ten o'clock, thinking it possible that the heads of the
      firm might not reach the counting-room till about that time. It was now
      eight o'clock only. He had two hours, therefore, to look about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shine yer boots?" said a ragged urchin, approaching, with a suggestive
      look at his soiled shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Herbert that it would be best to look as well as possible
      when visiting Godfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten cents."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's too much," said Herbert, thinking how few dimes constituted his
      entire worldly wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, five, then," said the bootblack, coming down to his regular price.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you get much to do?" asked our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some days I get considerable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much do you make?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pleasant days I makes a dollar, but when it rains, there ain't much to
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much do you have to pay for sleeping?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Six cents."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Six cents!" repeated Herbert, in surprise. "Where can you get lodged for
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the lodgin' house, corner of Fulton and Nassau Streets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," thought Herbert, "I needn't starve. If I can't get anything better
      to do, I can buy a box of blacking and a brush, and set up in business for
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, this would not be an agreeable occupation, but Herbert was
      bound to make a living by honest labor. If one avenue was closed to him,
      he must enter such as were open to him. He could not afford to be
      particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his shoes were brushed, he crossed the park, and walked up Broadway.
      It was a wonderful sight to the country-bred boy, this gay thoroughfare,
      with its busy and bustling crowds, and its throngs of vehicles, never
      ceasing wholly, save at the dead hours of night. He thought to himself
      what a quantity of business there must be to do. Certainly, there must be
      room for one more worker. So, on the whole, the busy scene gave him
      courage, and he sauntered along as cheerfully as if he were not next-door
      to a beggar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last the time came when he might safely seek out the gentleman to
      whom he had an introduction. Being a stranger in the city, he had to
      inquire for Pearl Street from a policeman, who answered his inquiry very
      civilly. He followed the direction, and found it at length. But the number
      of which he was in search was not so easily found, for he found the street
      meandered in a very perplexing way, so that at times he was not quite sure
      whether he was still in it, or had wandered from his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he found the place. It was a large, solid-looking building, of
      four stories in height. There were a number of boxes outside on the
      sidewalk. Inside, there was a large apartment occupying the entire first
      floor, with the exception of a room in the rear, which had been
      partitioned off for a counting-room. The partition was of glass, and, as
      he looked from the entrance, he could see a couple of high desks and a
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this Godfrey &amp; Lynn's?" he asked of a porter at the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to see Mr. Godfrey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think he's in. You can go to the office and inquire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, Herbert passed down the length of the warehouse, and, pausing
      a moment before the door, he opened it, and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two persons in the office. One was a thin-faced man, who sat on
      a high stool at one of the desks, making entries apparently in the ledger.
      This was the bookkeeper, Mr. Pratt, a man with a melancholy face, who
      looked as if he had lived to see the vanity of all things earthly. He had
      a high forehead naturally&mdash;made still higher by the loss of his front
      hair. Apparently, he was not a man to enjoy conviviality, or to shine on
      any festive occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides Mr. Pratt, there was a boy, if we may take the liberty of calling
      him such, of about Herbert's age. He was fashionably dressed, and his hair
      was arranged with exceeding care. In fact, as Herbert entered, he was
      examining the set of his necktie in a little hand-glass, which he had
      taken from his coat pocket. Not quite suiting him, he set himself to
      rearranging it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you copied that bill, Thomas?" asked Mr. Pratt, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been long enough about it. Put back that glass. You are quite
      too much troubled about your appearance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I didn't look any better than some people," said Thomas, sotto voce,
      "I shouldn't look in a glass very often."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert naturally concluded that Mr. Pratt was the man to whom his
      inquiries should be addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would like to see Mr. Godfrey, sir." he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is out of the city."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of the city!" repeated Herbert, disappointed. "When will he be back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor till day after to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert's countenance fell. In his reduced circumstances, he could hardly
      afford to wait two days. At his present rate of expenditure, he would be
      penniless by that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. Lynn likely to be in soon?" he asked, thinking that perhaps he
      would do in Mr. Godfrey's absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; he is sick at home. He may not be here for a week. Perhaps, I can
      attend to your business," he added. "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," said Herbert, "that I will wait till day after to-morrow, if
      you think Mr. Godfrey will be back then. I have a letter for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it's a business letter, you had better leave it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a letter of introduction," said Herbert. "I would rather present it
      in person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," and Mr. Pratt went back to his ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas looked critically at the boy who had a letter of introduction to
      Mr. Godfrey, and said to himself, "He got his clothes from a country
      tailor, I'll bet a hat."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FINDING A BOARDING PLACE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Herbert left the counting-room of Godfrey &amp; Lynn, not a little
      depressed in spirits. The two days which must elapse before he could see
      Mr. Godfrey were to him a formidable delay. By that time his money would
      be almost exhausted. Then, suppose, which was very probable, Mr. Godfrey
      could do nothing for him immediately, but only hold out his promise of
      future assistance, how was he to live in the meantime? After all, he might
      have to realize his thought of the morning, and join the ranks of the
      bootblacks. That was not a pleasant thought to a boy of his education. All
      labor is honorable, to be sure, but, then, some occupations are more
      congenial than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Greenleaf had not robbed him so basely, he could have afforded to wait.
      He felt sore and indignant about that. Nobody likes to own that he has
      been victimized, but Herbert was obliged to confess to himself that such
      was the case with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked about rather aimlessly, feeling miserable enough. But, all at
      once, it occurred to him, "Would it not be cheaper for him to take board
      by the week in some boarding-house?" Reckoning up, he found that his hotel
      bill would be three dollars and a half a week, while his meals, even if he
      were quite abstemious, would make as much more; in all, seven dollars.
      Surely, he could be boarded somewhere for less than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the reading-room of the hotel he found a daily paper, and carefully ran
      his eye down the advertisements for boarders and lodgers. The following
      attracted his attention:
    </p>
    <p>
      "BOARDERS WANTED.&mdash;A few mechanics may obtain comfortable rooms and
      board at No. &mdash;&mdash; Stanton Street, at three dollars per week."
    </p>
    <p>
      This, be it remembered, was previous to the war, and before the price of
      board had doubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three dollars a week!" repeated Herbert. "Less than half my present rate
      of expense. I must go at once and secure it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the way to Stanton Street, and found that No. &mdash;&mdash; was
      a shabby-looking house in a shabby neighborhood. But he could not afford
      to be fastidious. He accordingly stepped up without hesitation, and rang
      the bell, which emitted a shrill sound in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      A middle-aged woman, with a red handkerchief tied around her head, and a
      broom in her hand, opened the door and looked inquiringly at our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's wanted?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw your advertisement for boarders," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I advertised in the paper this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you let me see your rooms?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you looking for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know as you'll be suited. My price is low, and I can't give
      first-class accommodations for three dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I suppose not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come up, if you would like to see what I've got."
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the house was shabby like the outside, the oilcloth carpet
      faded, and the wall paper torn off in places. The stairs, too, were narrow
      and uncarpeted. All this Herbert observed, but he could not afford to be
      critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third floor, his guide threw open the door of a dark, little hall
      bedroom, meagerly furnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could give you this room by yourself," she said, "or a larger room with
      someone else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather be alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the only single room I have. Will you take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so," said Herbert, though he did not anticipate much enjoyment in
      such a poor place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When do you want to come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. I shall expect a deposit, so that I may be sure the room is
      let."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dollar will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert drew a dollar from his pocket, and handed it to Mrs. Morgan, for
      such, she informed him, was her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went downstairs and out into the air again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said to himself, "I'm sure of a home, such as it is, for a
      week. In that time something must turn up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Examining his pocketbook he found that he had two dollars and a half left.
      Of that sum, two dollars must be reserved to pay the balance of his week's
      board. Out of the remaining fifty cents he must pay for his meals until
      the next morning, when he would take possession of his new boarding place.
      He wished that he had proposed to come to breakfast, but it was too late
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such a small sum in hand, he could not afford to dine on the same
      magnificent scale as he had breakfasted, but he must be rigidly
      economical. He decided that the cheapest food he could buy was a five-cent
      loaf at some baker's. This would probably last him through the day, and
      might prove sufficient for breakfast also, since he would take a regular
      dinner, though he doubted, from what he had seen of the establishment in
      Stanton Street, whether it would be a very inviting repast. But it was the
      best he could afford, and that was all he need consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon, it occurred to Herbert to wonder where, in the
      city, his Uncle Stanton lived. Not that he had any intention of applying
      to him for assistance, even if matters came to a crisis, but he felt a
      natural curiosity as to how his uncle was situated. He found the directory
      readily, and, turning to the letter S, ran down the list of names till he
      came to Stanton, Benjamin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He learned that his uncle's store was in the lower part of Broadway, while
      his house was in West Seventeenth Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see what sort of a house Uncle Benjamin lives in,"
      thought Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to prevent his gratifying this wish, as he had plenty of
      time on his hands. If he had had more money, he would have taken the horse
      cars, but in his present circumstances this would be imprudent. He
      decided, as it was only five o'clock, to take a leisurely walk up
      Broadway, noticing his uncle's place of business on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes brought him in front of the latter&mdash;an imposing-looking
      building, with all the appearance of belonging to a prosperous merchant.
      Appearances are deceitful, to be sure, and no doubt there are some
      merchants, as outwardly prosperous, who might profitably change places
      with their head clerks. But Herbert naturally judged from appearances, and
      he could not help contrasting in his mind his own condition with that of
      his uncle's. But he was too manly to be despondent on this account, and
      thought rather, "I am young and ready to work, Some time, if I am patient
      and work hard. I may be as well off as Uncle Benjamin." The thought of
      applying to him for assistance was as far off as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pursued his way uptown, finding it a longer walk than he anticipated,
      arriving at half-past five at Union Square. At the upper end he turned
      off, and went down Seventeenth Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carefully noting the numbers, he at length found his uncle's house. It was
      a handsome, substantial city mansion, and seemed appropriate as the
      residence of a rich New York merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So my uncle lives here," thought Herbert, and there rose involuntarily in
      his mind the memory of the humble Western home where he and his mother had
      struggled against poverty, while his uncle, who was evidently so amply
      provided with the world's goods, coldly held aloof, and forbore to offer
      the assistance which he could so well afford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I had a sister, I could never treat her like that," thought Herbert,
      indignantly. "He would not help my mother. I will starve before I ask him
      to help me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment on the opposite side of the street to look at his
      uncle's house. While he was standing there, a boy of about his own age,
      apparently, came down the street whistling, and ascended the steps of his
      uncle's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if that is my cousin Tom," thought Herbert. He knew the names of
      his cousins from his mother, though he had never seen them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he looked, he was struck by something familiar in the appearance of
      this boy. Where had he seen him before?
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once it flashed upon him. It was the same boy he had seen in the
      counting-room of Godfrey He knew him by his dandified dress and his face,
      which he had noticed at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was certainly a strange coincidence, that his cousin, for it was
      doubtless he, should be the first boy he encountered after reaching New
      York. It would be still stranger if Mr. Godfrey should offer him
      employment, and he should find himself a clerk in the same office as the
      son of his rich uncle. But it was by no means certain that he would be
      lucky enough to obtain such employment. Therefore there was no need of
      wondering whether, under such circumstances, Tom would recognize him as a
      relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert walked thoughtfully back, and on reaching his room ate the
      remainder of the loaf which he had purchased at the baker's in the
      morning. It was not a very luxurious repast, but his walk had given him an
      appetite, and he had no difficulty in disposing of all that was left.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      GETTING A SITUATION
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next morning Herbert reported himself at his new boarding place. He
      found the fare very far from first-class, while his fellow-boarders
      appeared at the table mostly in shirt-sleeves, and were evidently
      workingmen. Our hero would have preferred a greater degree of neatness
      both in the table and in the guests, but he felt that he would be lucky,
      if he should find himself able to pay his expenses even here. He was not
      to be daunted by little annoyances, but looked for compensation in the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited impatiently for the next day, when Mr. Godfrey would return.
      Upon the success of the interview with him much depended.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length it came, and Herbert once more set out for the warehouse on
      Pearl Street. He entered without question, and made his way to the
      counting-room. Looking through the glass door, he saw his cousin&mdash;whom
      he surveyed with new interest now that he knew the relationship&mdash;and
      the bookkeeper. But, besides these, there was an elderly gentleman, rather
      stout, with a pleasant face, the expression of which reassured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. Godfrey in?" he asked, on entering, with a look of inquiry at the
      gentleman just described.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my name. What can I do for you?" said Mr. Godfrey, turning
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a letter for you, sir," said Herbert, producing it from his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Godfrey held out his hand for it, and ran his eye rapidly over its
      contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So your name is Herbert Mason?" he said, raising his eyes after finishing
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of this name, Tom Stanton, whose curiosity had led him to
      listen to the conversation, wheeled rapidly round on his stool and
      surveyed our hero with intense curiosity. He knew that Herbert Mason was
      the name of his cousin. Could it be possible that this boy was the cousin
      whom he had never seen? A little later, and he was convinced of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have just come from Ohio, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, Mr. Carroll, writes me that you were instrumental in saving
      him from being robbed while acting as his escort to Philadelphia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't worth mentioning," said Herbert modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Godfrey noticed his modest tone, and it pleased him&mdash;modesty not
      being an unvarying characteristic of young America.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend refers to it as an important service. I should like to know the
      particulars. Mr. Carroll is a connection of mine, and I am naturally
      interested in all that relates to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply Herbert gave a brief, but clear and intelligent account of the
      attempted burglary, passing over his own achievement as lightly as
      possible. But it was easy to infer, even from the little he said, that he
      had acted with bravery and self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You behaved in a very creditable manner," said Mr. Godfrey, approvingly.
      "Many boys would have lost their self-possession. You have come to New
      York in search of employment, Mr. Carroll writes me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't, of course, know how you were situated in Ohio," said the
      merchant, "but as a general rule I think boys make a mistake in leaving
      the country for the city. Here the competition for work is sharp, and
      there is a surplus of laborers in every department of labor. Still," he
      proceeded, scanning Herbert's earnest face, "you look like a boy capable
      of making his way if an opportunity offers. You have but little money, Mr.
      Carroll writes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have lost nearly all I had," said Herbert, "so that now I have very
      little left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have met with a loss? Tell me about it. Indeed, I should be glad if
      you would confide to me freely your situation and hopes, and then I shall
      be better able to help you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am almost ashamed to tell you how I was taken in," said our hero. "I
      suppose I ought to have been more prudent."
    </p>
    <p>
      He recounted the manner in which Greenleaf had robbed him. Mr. Godfrey
      listened with interest, and so did Tom Stanton, who burst into a laugh
      when the narrative was concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you laughing at, Thomas?" asked the merchant, rather sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking how neatly he was taken in," said Tom, a little abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should apply a different word to it," said Mr. Godfrey. "It appears to
      me the height, or rather the depth of meanness, to take advantage of a
      boy's confidence, and defraud him so scandalously. How much money have you
      left, Herbert?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forty cents, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only forty cents to begin life with in a great city!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; I have paid my board in advance for a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you board?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Stanton Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom turned up his nose at the name of this street, which he knew was very
      far from fashionable, but this demonstration our hero did not observe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What board do you pay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three dollars a week, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A poor place, probably."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, but I could afford no better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are sensible to accommodate yourself to circumstances. Well, my young
      friend, it appears that you can't wait long for employment. Mr. Carroll
      has asked me to do something for you, and I am disposed to oblige him, not
      wholly for his sake, but partly for your own, for you seem to me a very
      modest and sensible boy. Mr. Pratt, do we need another boy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, I don't think we do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, business will be brisker by and by. I think you can find a little
      for this young man to do in the meantime. He can go to the post office,
      and I believe I have a little extra writing to be done. Pass him a pen,
      and let him give us a specimen of his handwriting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, Herbert was a handsome writer, and this went a considerable
      way in his favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very neat," said the merchant. "By the way, Herbert, I suppose, of
      course, you know nothing of French?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, I can read it pretty well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said Mr. Godfrey, surprised. "Then you can be of service to me,
      that is, if you know it well enough. I received, this morning, a letter
      from a silk house at Lyons, a part of which I don't quite understand. The
      fact is, my French is rather poor. Do you think you could help me
      translate it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will show me the letter, I will try, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchant took a letter from the table before him and handed it to
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hero ran his eye rapidly over it, and then rendered it into English in
      a clear and grammatical way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me, you're quite a scholar," said Mr. Godfrey. "I understand now.
      You've made it all plain. Where did you learn so much French?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father taught me, sir. He also taught me Latin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I congratulate you on possessing so good an education. Latin,
      however, isn't so much in my way. I haven't many Latin correspondents."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose not, sir," said Herbert, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, it does no harm to know something of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Stanton had listened with considerable surprise, mingled with
      mortification, to what had passed. It appeared then, that his country
      cousin, whom he had looked upon as a country boor, was his superior in
      education, and, as Tom secretly knew, in courage. And now he was going to
      be his fellow-clerk. He felt jealous and angry, fearing that Herbert, who
      appeared to be high in favor already, would eclipse him in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much can you live upon economically?" asked the merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know little of the city," said Herbert. "You can judge better than I,
      sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You pay three dollars a week board. You'll need double that amount. Mr.
      Pratt, you may pay him six dollars a week. He will come to work to-morrow
      morning, and you may pay him Saturday, as if it was a whole week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir," said Herbert, gratefully. "You are very kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do your duty, my young friend, and I shall be satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Stanton listened in indignant surprise. He only got four dollars a
      week, and here was a country boy placed over his head. He was imprudent
      enough to give expression to his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you give me six dollars a week, also?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't I deserve as much as he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you do. But I don't give it to Herbert because he earns it, for
      it is not likely that he will do so at present. But he has no other
      resources. You have a comfortable home, and are not obliged to pay for
      your board out of your wages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I hope not," said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore you do not need as much as he does. You are not entitled to
      this explanation, but I give it, nevertheless, that you may know my
      motives."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom did not reply, feeling that it would be imprudent to do so, but he
      bent sullenly to his work, by no mans satisfied with the explanation. He
      began to feel a dislike for his cousin, and determined to injure him, if
      he could, in the estimation of the firm. It would have been satisfactory
      if he could have looked down upon him as an inferior, but that was not
      easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope the fellow won't find out the relationship between us," he said to
      himself. "He'd be calling me Cousin Tom all the time, and I don't care
      about owning a cousin that lives in Stanton Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom need not have troubled himself. Herbert had no idea of claiming
      relationship, though, as we know, he was fully aware of its existence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A FAMILY COUNCIL
    </h3>
    <p>
      As soon as he was released from business, Tom Stanton hurried home to
      impart the unexpected intelligence that his cousin Herbert had arrived in
      the city. As might be expected, the news gave no particular pleasure in
      the Stanton homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you tell him who you were, Thomas?" asked his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catch me doing it!" said Tom. "I ain't quite a fool. I don't care about
      owning any pauper relations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He isn't a pauper," said Mr. Stanton, who, hard man of the world as he
      was, could not forget that Herbert was the son of his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's the next door to it," said Tom, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thomas is right," said Mrs. Stanton. "You may depend upon it, Mr.
      Stanton, that when this boy finds you out, he will apply to you for
      assistance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly he may."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you won't be such a fool as to encourage him in his application."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he were in actual distress, my dear," said Mr. Stanton, "I should feel
      that I ought to do something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you'd allow yourself to be imposed upon, that's all I've got to say.
      There is no need of his being in distress. He is a stout boy, and capable
      of earning his own living."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might get sick," suggested Mr. Stanton, who was not so hard-hearted as
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then let him go to the hospital. It's provided for such cases."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Herbert good-looking?" asked Maria, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He won't get a prize for his beauty," said Tom, disparagingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he homely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Tom, reluctantly. "I suppose he'll pass; but he's countrified.
      He hasn't got any style," and he glanced complacently at his own
      reflection in a mirror, for Tom was vain of his personal appearance,
      though by no means as good-looking as Herbert. In fact, he was compelled
      secretly to confess this to himself, and for this reason was more than
      ever disposed to view his cousin with prejudice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to see Herbert," said Maria, who had her share of female
      curiosity, and thought it would be pleasant to have a cousin to escort her
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I'd better invite him round to dinner tomorrow," said Thomas,
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thomas will do no such thing!" said Mrs. Stanton, decidedly. "It's my
      opinion that the less notice we take of him the better. Your father is in
      good circumstances, to be sure, but whatever he is able to do, ought, of
      right, to go to his own family. We don't want any poor relations coming
      here to get their living out of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just my sentiments, mother," said Tom Stanton, approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't seem quite right," said Mr. Stanton, uncomfortably, "to
      neglect my sister's child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't make yourself ridiculous with your scruples, Mr. Stanton," said his
      wife. "It's the boy's duty to take care of himself. It would only do him
      harm, and lead to false expectations, if we allowed him the run of the
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides," said Tom, "I shouldn't want to have Tom Paget and Percy
      Mortimer, and other fellows that I associate with, ask me who he is, and
      have to tell them that he is my cousin."
    </p>
    <p>
      This argument had considerable weight with Mr. Stanton, who was anxious to
      elevate himself in society, and looked with complacency upon the school
      acquaintances Tom had formed with the scions of distinguished families.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, rising from the table, "let it be as you will. We won't
      go out of our way to invite the boy here, but if he presents himself, as
      he doubtless will, we must take a little notice of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see why he couldn't have stayed in the country," said Mrs.
      Stanton. "It was the best place for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, it was," said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He could have had no other object than to seek us out, and see what he
      could get out of us. For my part, I would advise you to recommend him to
      go back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has secured a place, it seems, and would not be likely to give it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a great pity he should have got into the same counting-room with
      Tom. He will presume on the relationship as soon as he finds it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Stanton need not have been alarmed, for Herbert was too high-spirited
      to seek an intimacy where he had reason to think it would be disagreeable.
      But his aunt knew nothing of him, and judged him by herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's there, and it can't be helped," said Mr. Stanton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate, if he does stay in the city," persisted Mrs. Stanton, "I
      hope you'll give him to understand that he needn't call here more than
      once in three months. That is as much as he can expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, he is my sister's son," said Mr. Stanton. "I can't feel that
      this would be quite kind in us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave it to me, then. If you're too soft-hearted, Mr. Stanton, I will
      take all the responsibility, and the blame, if there is any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I think you've said enough on the subject," said her husband. "Tom,
      run upstairs and bring me a cigar. You know where I keep the cigar box."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better send a servant, father," said Tom, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It appears to me you are getting lazy, Thomas," said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thomas is right," said Mrs. Stanton. "What do we keep servants for but to
      run errands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, Tom might have obliged me in such a little matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shouldn't have asked him, Mr. Stanton. You seem to forget that we are
      not living in the style of half a dozen years ago. You should adapt
      yourself to circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanton said no more, but sent a servant in Tom's place. But he could
      not help thinking that the outward prosperity for which he was striving
      was not without its drawbacks, since it compelled him to look to servants
      for the most ordinary services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Tom went to the counting-room, fully expecting that
      Herbert would claim relationship as soon as he discovered his name. While
      he would be compelled to admit it, he determined to treat Herbert with
      such a degree of coolness that he would take the hint, and keep his
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived at the counting-room, Herbert was already there, and Mr.
      Pratt also.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning," muttered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is Thomas Stanton, your fellow-clerk," said Mr. Pratt, the
      bookkeeper. "I believe you have not been introduced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now for it," thought Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But rather to his surprise, Herbert made no demonstration, but merely
      bowed slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does it mean?" thought Tom, a little perplexed. "Is it possible that
      he is not my cousin, after all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you came from Ohio?" inquired Tom, impelled by his curiosity to
      ask the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't you stay there? Couldn't you make a living there?" asked Tom,
      not over-politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably I might," said Herbert, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I think you should have stayed there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which do you like best, the city or the country?" asked our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The city."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there's a difference. I have always lived in the city."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose boys often do come from the country to the city," said Herbert.
      "Was your father born in the city?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Tom, glancing keenly at Herbert, to see if he meant anything by
      the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it seems he must have preferred the city to the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had his share of curiosity. He knew that it would be better not to
      pursue this subject further if he wished his cousin to remain ignorant of
      the relationship between them. Still, he was anxious to know what
      Herbert's actual knowledge was, and whether he would be likely to avail
      himself of it. He was therefore tempted to say, "I suppose you have no
      relations in the city?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes you think I haven't?" asked Herbert, looking at Tom rather
      peculiarly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think anything about it. I only asked," said Tom, a little
      confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I have an uncle in the city," said Herbert, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed," said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing more, for he felt that he might betray his knowledge of
      the relationship unintentionally. Herbert's manner left him as much in the
      dark as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pratt set Herbert to work on some writing, and Tom, also, was soon
      busy. After a while Mr. Godfrey came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning, Herbert," he said, pleasantly, offering his hand. "So Mr.
      Pratt has set you to work, has he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we shall find enough for him to do, eh, Mr. Pratt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, I think so," said the bookkeeper, who perceived that Herbert
      was in favor, and it was as well to fall in with his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's well. How do you like your boarding place, Herbert?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't a very nice one, sir, but it is as good a one as I have a right
      to expect for the money I pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come round and dine with us to-night," said the merchant. "Mrs. Godfrey
      will be glad to see you. I'll give you my street and number."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir," said Herbert. "I shall be glad to accept your kind
      invitation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom listened to this invitation with envy. Mr. Godfrey occupied a high
      social position. Moreover, he had a pretty daughter, whom he, Tom, had met
      at dancing school, and he would have been very glad to receive the
      invitation which had been extended to "that beggar, Herbert," as he
      mentally styled him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AT THE CONCERT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Herbert felt a little diffident about accepting his employer's invitation
      to dinner. Brought up in the country in comparative poverty, he felt
      afraid that he should show, in some way, his want of acquaintance with the
      etiquette of the dining table. But he had a better than ordinary
      education, and, having read diligently whatever books he could get hold
      of, possessed a fund of general information which enabled him to converse
      intelligently. Then his modest self-possession was of value to him, and
      enabled him to acquit himself very creditably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia Godfrey, the merchant's only daughter, was a lively and animated
      girl, a year or two younger than Herbert. She had been the belle of the
      dancing school, and Tom Stanton, among other boys, had always been proud
      to have her for a partner. She, however, had taken no particular fancy to
      Tom, whose evident satisfaction with himself naturally provoked criticisms
      on the part of others. Of this, however, Tom was unconscious, and
      flattered himself that his personal appearance was strikingly attractive,
      and was quite convinced that his elaborate and gorgeous neckties must
      attract admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia awaited the advent of her father's young guest with interest, and
      her verdict was favorable. He was, to be sure, very plainly dressed, but
      his frank and open face and pleasant expression did not need fine clothes
      to set them off. Julia at once commenced an animated conversation with our
      hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weren't you frightened when you saw the robber?" she asked, for her
      father had told her of Herbert's adventure with the burglar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Herbert, "I did not feel afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How brave you must be?" said Julia, with evident admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was no need of my being frightened," said Herbert, modestly. "I was
      expecting him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know I should have been frightened to death," said Julia, decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a girl, you know," said Herbert. "I suppose it is natural for
      girls to be timid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know but it is, but I am sure it is not natural to all boys to be
      brave."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was out in the country, one day, walking with Frank Percy," proceeded
      Julia, "when a big, ugly-looking dog met us. Frank, instead of standing
      by, and defending me, ran away as fast as his feet could carry him. I
      laughed at him so much about it that he doesn't like to come near me since
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you escape?" asked Herbert, with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw there was no use in running away, so I patted him on the head, and
      called him 'Poor dog,' though I expected every minute he was going to bite
      me. That calmed him down, and he went off without doing any harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert found Mrs. Godfrey to be a pleasant, motherly-looking lady, who
      received him kindly. He felt that he should like it very much if she was
      his aunt, instead of Mrs. Stanton, whom he had never seen, and did not
      think he should care about meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of Tom Stanton?" asked Julia, "Of course, you know him&mdash;the
      other boy in pa's counting-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not very well acquainted with him yet," said Herbert, evasively, for
      he did not care to say anything unfavorable of Tom. "Do you know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he used to go to the same dancing school with me last winter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you know him better than I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like him much," said Julia. "He's always thinking of himself and
      his neckties. He always came to dancing school in a different necktie; to
      let us know how many he had, I suppose. Didn't you notice his necktie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was pretty large, I thought," said Herbert, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he's fond of wearing large ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid you are talking uncharitably, Julia," said her mother,
      mildly. "Girls, you know, are sometimes fond of dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the conversation drifted on to other topics. Julia, at first, addressed
      our hero as Mr. Mason, until he requested her to call him Herbert, a
      request which she readily complied with. They were soon on excellent
      terms, and appeared to be mutually pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young people," said Mr. Godfrey, after dinner, "there is to be an
      attractive concert at the Academy of Music this evening. I secured seats
      this morning for four. Suppose we all go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be delighted, for one, papa," said Julia. "You will like to go,
      Herbert, won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much," said our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you can escort me, while papa and mamma walk together."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert felt that this arrangement would be very agreeable, so far as he
      was concerned. It was, in fact, adopted, and the four paired off together,
      as Julia had suggested, Julia amusing Herbert by her lively remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the hall, they followed the usher to their seats, which were
      eligibly located only a few rows back from the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just behind them sat a party, among whom the new arrivals produced quite a
      sensation. Not to keep the reader in suspense, that party consisted of Mr.
      and Mrs. Stanton, Tom and Maria. There was but slight acquaintance between
      the two families, as Mr. Godfrey's stood higher, socially, than Mr.
      Stanton's. The gentlemen, however, had a bowing acquaintance, and the
      young people had met at dancing school.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, there's Mr. Godfrey and his family, Tom," said Maria, turning
      towards her brother. "Who's that boy with them? Julia hasn't got any
      brother, has she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom had watched the entrance of the party with lively dissatisfaction.
      That his beggarly cousin should appear in public on such intimate terms
      with Julia Godfrey, to whom he himself had paid attention, but without any
      special encouragement, struck him as particularly mortifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Godfrey's son!" he said, disdainfully. "That boy is Herbert Mason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our cousin?" asked Maria, with interest. "Ma, did you hear?" she
      whispered, eagerly. "That boy in front of us is Cousin Herbert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That boy with the Godfreys?" said Mrs. Stanton, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he's talking with Julia now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure? Who told you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it true, Tom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Tom, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could have induced the Godfreys to bring him along?" said Mrs.
      Stanton, who was no better pleased than Tom at the social success of the
      poor relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's quite good-looking," said Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," said her mother, sharply. "He has a very countrified look."
    </p>
    <p>
      The news was communicated to Mr. Stanton, who looked with interest at his
      sister's son, whom he had not seen since he was a very young child. He
      fervently wished him back again in Ohio, where he might conveniently
      forget his existence. Here in New York, especially since an unlucky
      chance, as he considered it, had brought him into the same counting-room
      as his son, it would be difficult to avoid taking some notice of him. But,
      so far as pecuniary assistance was concerned, Mr. Stanton determined that
      he would give none, unless it was forced upon him. Had he known our hero
      better, he would have been less alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his prejudices, Mr. Stanton could not help confessing that
      Herbert was a boy of whom any uncle might be proud. Though plainly
      dressed, he did not seem out of place at a fashionable concert, surrounded
      by well-dressed people.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed that Herbert was left in ignorance of the vicinity
      of the only relations he had in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Tom Stanton, just behind you, with his father and mother and
      sister," whispered Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert turned his head slightly. He was desirous of seeing what his uncle
      and aunt were like. His uncle met his gaze, and turned uncomfortably away,
      appearing not to know him, yet conscious that in his affected ignorance he
      was acting shabbily. Mrs. Stanton did not flinch, but bent a cold gaze of
      scrutiny upon the unwelcome nephew. Tom looked supercilious, and elevated
      his pug nose a trifle. Maria, only, looked as if she would like to know
      her cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a hasty glance on Herbert's part, but it brought him to a
      rapid conclusion that he would not claim relationship. If any advances
      were made, they must come from the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom fidgeted in his seat, watching with ill-concealed vexation the
      confidential conversation which appeared to be going on between Julia and
      his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What she can see in that boor, I can't imagine," he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, though Julia had looked around, she had not deigned any
      recognition of himself, and this hurt his pride. He finally determined to
      overlook the neglect, and address her, which he could readily do, as he
      sat almost directly behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-evening, Miss Julia," he said, familiarly, bending forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, good-evening, Mr. Stanton," said Julia, coldly, just turning
      slightly. "Herbert, isn't that a beautiful song?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She calls him Herbert," said Tom, in scornful disgust. "I wonder if she
      knows he is nothing but a beggar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you enjoying the concert, Miss Julia?" he continued, resolved not
      to take the rebuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Julia. "By the way," she continued, with a sudden
      thought, "I believe you are acquainted with Mr. Mason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert, upon this, bowed pleasantly, but Tom said, in rather a
      disagreeable tone, "I know Mr. Mason slightly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Julia, arching her eyebrows, "I thought you were both in papa's
      counting-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall know each other better by and by," said Herbert, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom did not appear to hear this, but tried to keep up the conversation
      with Julia, desiring to have it appear that they were intimate friends;
      but the young lady gave brief replies, and finally, turning away, devoted
      herself once more to Herbert, much to Tom's disgust. In fact, what he saw
      made Tom pass a very unpleasant evening, and when, on their return home,
      Maria suggested that Julia had taken a fancy to Herbert, he told her to
      mind her own business, which Maria justly considered a piece of rudeness
      wholly uncalled for.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PETER GREENLEAF AGAIN
    </h3>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding he was receiving a salary larger than is usually paid boys
      of his age, Herbert felt cramped for the want of money. Six dollars a week
      would have paid his expenses comfortably, if he had been well provided to
      begin with. But all the clothing he had, besides what he wore, he had
      brought with him in a small bundle, the greatest part having been left in
      his trunk at the house of Abner Holden. He often wished that he could have
      them with him, but, of course, this wish was vain. Indeed, Mr. Holden,
      when the conviction was forced upon him that there was no chance of
      recovering his bound boy, quietly confiscated the trunk and its contents;
      and this, to some extent, consoled him for the departure of the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert found himself sadly in need of underclothing; and, of course, his
      only suit, from constant wear, was likely to deteriorate rapidly. He saved
      all the money he could from his weekly wages toward purchasing a new one,
      but his savings were inconsiderable. Besides, he needed a trunk, or would
      need one, when he had anything to put in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I only had that money Greenleaf stole from me, I should be all right,"
      he said to himself, after long and anxious thought on the great question
      of ways and means. "I don't see how I can save up more than two dollars a
      week out of my wages, and it will take a long time for that to amount to
      much."
    </p>
    <p>
      There certainly did not appear to be much chance of saving more. His
      boarding place was as cheap as he could obtain, or, if there were cheaper
      anywhere, they would probably be also poorer, and our hero felt that Mrs.
      Morgan's was as poor as he should be able to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was rather mortified, too, at the poverty of his wardrobe. Mrs. Morgan
      asked him one day, "When is your trunk coming?" and Herbert was obliged to
      own, with some shame, that he had none. The landlady looked surprised, but
      he had no explanation to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose I shall have to wait till my wages are raised," thought
      Herbert, with a little sigh. This, he reflected, would not be very soon,
      as he had started with a salary greater than he was likely to earn, as Mr.
      Godfrey had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But relief was nearer than he anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, as he was walking up the Bowery, he saw, at a little distance in
      front of him, a figure which he well remembered. The careless, jaunty step
      and well-satisfied air were familiar to him. In short, it was Peter
      Greenleaf, who had played so mean a trick upon him at the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert's heart beat quick with excitement, mingled with pleasure. He felt
      a natural indignation against this young man, who had cheated him so
      remorselessly, and left him, indifferent to his fate, alone and almost
      penniless in a strange city.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should he do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Close behind him was a policeman slowly pacing his regular round. Herbert
      went up to him, and, pointing to Greenleaf, rapidly recounted his
      grievances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a mean trick," said the policeman, who was a favorable specimen of
      his class. "Is this the first time you have seen him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me what you want to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to get my money back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably he has spent it. How long since he robbed you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much chance, then. Probably his pocket's empty, unless he's fleeced
      somebody else in the meantime. However, it's as well to see what can be
      done. Now, I'll tell you how to act. Go up to him boldly, and demand your
      money. If he bluffs you off, call me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastened his step, and, advancing, tapped Greenleaf on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greenleaf turned. When he recognized Herbert, he looked surprised and
      disconcerted. But he had plenty of assurance, and quickly determined upon
      his course. Assuming a stolid look, he said: "Well, my lad, who are you;
      and what do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know who I am, well enough," said Herbert, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I? Then I'm uncommonly forgetful. I haven't any recollection of your
      interesting countenance," he said, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you don't want to remember me, Mr. Greenleaf," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Greenleaf! You are thinking of somebody else. My name's Thompson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your name was Greenleaf when you stopped with me at French's Hotel," said
      Herbert, sturdily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're crazy, I fancy," said Greenleaf, shrugging his shoulders. "I never
      stopped at the hotel you mention, in my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's the money you took from me?" demanded Herbert, who felt convinced
      of Greenleaf's identity, in spite of his denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you talking about?" said Greenleaf, assuming a look of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You went off before I was awake, with more than fifty dollars of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to insult me?" said Greenleaf, drawing himself up. "I've a
      great mind to knock you over!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Greenleaf," said Herbert, firmly, "either return my money, or as much
      as you have got left, or I will call a policeman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just what I shall do, myself, unless you stop this nonsense," said
      Greenleaf, angrily; but not without a sensation of uneasiness, as it
      struck his mind that Herbert might really intend to do what he had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once more, will you give up that money?" said Herbert, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand out of the way," said Greenleaf, "if you know what is best for
      yourself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to push by, thrusting Herbert roughly out of the way, when
      our hero turned, and his look summoned the policeman, who hastened to the
      spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give this boy his money," he said, authoritatively. "I know all about
      your little game. It's up now. Unless you hand over your plunder, you must
      go with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Greenleaf changed color, and was evidently alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got nobody's money, except my own," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along, then," said the officer, taking him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop a minute," said he, hurriedly, finding that matters had come to a
      crisis. "If I give up what I have, will you let me go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that depends on how much you have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got twenty dollars."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert was about to say that this would do, but the policeman shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't do," said he. "Come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little haggling, Greenleaf produced forty dollars, which Herbert
      pocketed, with much satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now go along, and mind you don't try any more such games."
    </p>
    <p>
      Greenleaf needed no second permission to be gone. He feared that the
      officer might change his mind, and he might, after all, be consigned to
      the station house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Herbert, gratefully. "I needed the money badly. I
      shouldn't have recovered it but for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take better care of it next time," said the officer, not unkindly. "Take
      care not to trust a stranger too easily. Better take my advice, and put it
      in a savings bank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be obliged to use most of it," said Herbert. "What I don't need,
      I will put in the bank."
    </p>
    <p>
      The recovery of so much of his lost money seemed to Herbert quite a lucky
      windfall. He went at once to a trunk store, and, for five dollars,
      purchased a good, durable trunk, which he ordered sent home to his
      lodgings. Fifteen dollars more he invested in necessary underclothing, and
      this left him one-half of the money for future use. Besides this he had
      six dollars, which, in three weeks, he had saved from his wages. With this
      sum, and the articles he had purchased, he felt quite rich, and returned
      to the counting-room&mdash;this happened during the hour given him for
      dinner&mdash;in unusually good spirits. He had other reasons for
      encouragement. He was getting accustomed to his duties at the
      counting-room. Mr. Godfrey always treated him kindly, and had called upon
      him again that very morning to assist him in translating a French letter,
      complimenting him, at the same time, upon his scholarship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll do my best," thought Herbert. "'Try and Trust,' that's my motto. I
      think it will bring me success."
    </p>
    <p>
      But even while he spoke, an unforeseen danger menaced him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SPARRING
    </h3>
    <p>
      After the concert, Tom Stanton took even a greater dislike to his cousin
      than before. To say that he was in love with Julia Godfrey would be rather
      ridiculous, considering his youth. Even if he had been older, Tom cared
      too much about himself to fall in love with another. But Julia had been a
      belle among the children of her own age at the dancing school, and there
      was considerable rivalry among the boys&mdash;or, I should, perhaps, say
      young gentlemen&mdash;for the honor of her notice. Tom desired it, because
      it would give him a kind of distinction among his fellows. So, though he
      was not in love with Julia, he was jealous when she showed favor to anyone
      else. But this feeling was mild compared with that he experienced when
      Julia bestowed her notice upon his penniless cousin. That Herbert should
      be preferred to himself, he thought, not only showed great lack of taste
      on the part of the young heiress, but was a grievous wrong to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't understand how girls can be such fools," thought Tom, as that
      evening, after returning from the concert, he surveyed his rather
      perturbed face in the mirror surmounting his bureau. "I wouldn't have
      believed Julia Godfrey would stoop to notice such a pauper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a cheerful thought came to him. Perhaps she was only trying to rouse
      his jealousy. He had heard of such things. But, if so, why should she
      choose such a beggar as Herbert to practice her arts upon?
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, to an unprejudiced observer, such a thought would never have
      suggested itself. The cool indifference with which Julia had treated Tom
      did not appear to argue any such feeling as would lead to the attempt to
      rouse his jealousy. But, then, Tom was not an unprejudiced observer, and
      considered his personal attractions such that any girl might appreciate
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived at the counting-room the next morning, he found Herbert
      already there. Indeed, our hero was very particular to be punctual in his
      attendance, while Tom was generally at least a quarter of an hour behind
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw you at the concert last evening, Mason," said Tom, who wanted to
      get a chance to say something disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I was there," said Herbert. "You sat in the row just behind us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I suppose you were never at a concert before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in New York."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Godfrey was very kind to take you."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what Herbert thought himself. But as Tom expressed it, there was
      something in his tone which implied a conviction of Herbert's social
      inferiority, which our hero did not like.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have found Mr. Godfrey very kind," he said, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are not many employers who would invite a boy in your position to a
      concert with his family," said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe my position is the same as yours," said Herbert, nettled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see it," said Tom, haughtily. "Will you explain yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe we are both in Mr. Godfrey's employ," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, so far as that goes. But I am the son of a rich man," said Tom,
      pompously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert might have replied that he was the nephew of a rich man, but he
      had no disposition to boast of his relationship to his cousin's family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see that that makes any difference," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you? Well, I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are both boys in Mr. Godfrey's employ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true, but then, he took you out of pity, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's tone as he said this was very aggravating, and Herbert's face
      flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know anything of the sort," he retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I suppose you don't consider it in that light," said Tom, carelessly;
      "but, of course, it is clear enough to others. Where would you have been,
      if Mr. Godfrey hadn't given you a place? Blacking boots, probably, among
      the street ragamuffins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I might," said Herbert, quietly, "if I couldn't have got anything
      better to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a very genteel occupation," sneered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think it is," said Herbert, "but it's an honest one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may have to take it yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps so. So may you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to insult me?" demanded Tom, haughtily, his face flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only said to you the same thing you said to me. If it's an insult on
      one side, it is on the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to forget that our circumstances are very different," said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are just now, so far as money goes. I get a larger salary than you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was very much incensed at this remark, being aggrieved by the fact
      that Herbert received more than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't mean that," said he. "Of course, if Mr. Godfrey chooses to give
      away money in charity, it is none of my business. I don't need any
      charity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Godfrey pays me for my services," said Herbert. "If he pays me too
      liberally now, I hope to make it up to him afterward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seemed to be very intimate with Julia Godfrey last evening," said
      Tom, unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I found her very pleasant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; she is very kind to take notice of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose the notice you have taken of me this morning is meant in
      kindness," said Herbert, thinking his cousin very disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course, being in the same counting-room, I think it right to take
      some notice of you," said Tom, condescendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very much obliged to you," said Herbert, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there's one piece of advice I should like to give you," proceeded
      Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?" inquired Herbert, looking his cousin in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't feel too much set up by Julia Godfrey's notice. She only took
      notice of you out of pity, and to encourage you. If you had been in her
      own position in society&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like you, for instance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, like me," said Tom, complacently, "she would have been more
      ceremonious. I thought I would just mention it to you, Mason, or you might
      not understand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only natural that Herbert should be provoked by this elaborate
      humiliation suggested by Tom, and his cousin's offensive assumption of
      superiority. This led him to a retort in kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose that is the reason she took so little notice of you," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was nettled at this statement of a fact, but he answered in an
      off-hand manner, "Oh, Julia and I are old friends. I've danced with her
      frequently at dancing school."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert happened to remember what Julia had said of his cousin, and was
      rather amused at this assumption of intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am much obliged to you for your information," said Herbert, "though I
      am rather surprised that you should take so great an interest in my
      affairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you're new in the city, and I know all the ropes," said Tom. "I
      thought I might as well give you a friendly hint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am lucky in having such a friend," said Herbert, "and will take the
      advice as it was given."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the bookkeeper entered, and, soon after, Mr. Godfrey made his
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you had a pleasant evening, Herbert," he said, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very pleasant, sir; thank you," said Herbert, in a very different tone
      from the one he had used in addressing Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I saw you, also, at the concert, Thomas," said Mr. Godfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said Tom. "I am very fond of music, and attend all the
      first-class musical entertainments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed?" said Mr. Godfrey, but this was all the reply he made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter insists that I shall invite you to the house again soon,"
      said Mr. Godfrey, again addressing Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very much obliged to her, and to you, sir," said Herbert, modestly.
      "I shall be very glad to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's face darkened, as he heard this. He would have given considerable to
      receive such an invitation himself, but the prospect did not seem very
      promising.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Godfrey must be infatuated," he said to himself, impatiently, "to
      invite such a beggar to his house. Mason ought to have good sense enough
      to feel that he is out of place in such a house. I wouldn't accept any
      invitation given out of pity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder why Tom dislikes me so much?" thought Herbert. "He certainly
      takes pains enough to show his feeling. Would it be different, I wonder,
      if he knew that I was his cousin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert thought of mentioning to Mr. Godfrey that he had recovered
      three-quarters of the money of which he had been robbed. It would have
      been well if he had done so, but Mr. Godfrey seemed particularly engaged,
      and he thought it best not to interrupt him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN UNEXPECTED BLOW
    </h3>
    <p>
      Herbert felt happier than usual. He had recovered the greater part of his
      money, and thus was relieved from various inconveniences which had
      resulted from his straitened circumstances, He was the more elated at
      this, as it had seemed extremely improbable that the lost money would ever
      have found its way back to the pocket of its rightful owner. Then, he had
      a good place, and a salary sufficient to defray his modest expenses, and
      the prospect of promotion, if he should be faithful to the interests of
      his employer, as he firmly intended to be. It was agreeable, also, to
      reflect that he was in favor with Mr. Godfrey, who had thus far treated
      him with as much kindness as if he had been his own son.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, to be sure, the drawback of Tom's enmity, but, as there was no
      good reason for this, he would not allow it to trouble him much, though,
      of course, it would have been more agreeable if all in the office had been
      his friends. He determined to take an early opportunity to write to his
      good friend, Dr. Kent, an account of his present position. He would have
      done so before, but had hesitated from the fear that in some way the
      intelligence would reach Abner Holden, whom he preferred to leave in
      ignorance of all that concerned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      These thoughts passed through Herbert's mind as he went about his daily
      work. Meanwhile, a painful experience awaited him, for which he was not in
      the least prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      About one o'clock a gentleman entered the counting-room hastily, and said,
      "Mr. Godfrey, I wonder whether I happened to leave my pocketbook anywhere
      about your office when I was here an hour ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think so. When did you miss it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few minutes since. I went to a restaurant to get a lunch, and, on
      finishing it, felt for my pocketbook, and found it gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was there much in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sum of any consequence. Between twenty and thirty dollars, I believe.
      There were, however, some papers of value, which I shall be sorry to
      lose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly think you could have left it here. However, I will inquire. Mr.
      Pratt, have you seen anything of Mr. Walton's pocketbook?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said the bookkeeper, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert, have you seen it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thomas?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Stanton was assailed by a sudden and dangerous temptation. His dislike
      to Herbert had been increased in various ways, and especially had been
      rendered more intense by the independent tone assumed by our hero in the
      conversation which had taken place between them that very morning. Now,
      here was an opportunity of getting him into disgrace, and probably cause
      him to lose his situation. True, he would have to tell a falsehood, but
      Tom had never been a scrupulous lover of truth, and would violate it for a
      less object without any particular compunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated when the question was asked him, and thus, as he expected,
      fixed Mr. Godfrey's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you answer, Thomas?" he said, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like to," said Tom, artfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" demanded his employer, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I don't want to get anybody into trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak out what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you insist upon it," said Tom, with pretended reluctance, "I suppose I
      must obey you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, if any wrong has been done, it is your duty to expose it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, sir," said Tom. "I saw Mason pick up a wallet from the floor, and
      put it in his pocket just after the gentleman went out. He did it so
      quickly that no one probably observed it but myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert listened to this accusation as if stunned. It was utterly beyond
      his conception how anyone could be guilty of such a deliberate falsehood
      as he had just listened to. So he remained silent, and this operated
      against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert," said Mr. Godfrey, mildly, for he was unwilling to believe our
      hero guilty of intentional dishonesty, "you should have mentioned having
      found the pocketbook."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I would, sir," said Herbert, having found his voice at last, "if I had
      found one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say that you have not?" demanded Mr. Godfrey, with a
      searching look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," said Herbert, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, then, does Thomas mean when he asserts that he saw you do so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, sir. I think he means to injure me, as I have noticed ever
      since I entered the office that he seems to dislike me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is that, Thomas? Do you again declare that you saw Herbert pick up
      the wallet?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," said Tom, boldly. "Of course, I expected that he would deny it. I
      leave it to you, sir, if he does not show his guilt in his face? Just look
      at him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it, unfortunately for Herbert, happened that his indignation had
      brought a flush to his face, and he certainly did look as a guilty person
      is supposed to do. Mr. Godfrey observed this, and his heart sank within
      him, for, unable to conceive of such wickedness as Tom's, he saw no other
      way except to believe in Herbert's guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you nothing to say, Herbert?" he asked, more in sorrow than in
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said Herbert, in a low voice; "nothing, except what I have
      already said. Tom has uttered a wicked falsehood, and he knows it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I expected you would say that," said Tom, with effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a serious charge, Herbert," proceeded Mr. Godfrey. "I shall have
      to ask you to produce whatever you have in your pockets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sir," said our hero, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as he spoke, it flashed upon him that he had in his pocket twenty-six
      dollars, and the discovery of this sum would be likely to involve him in
      suspicion. He could, indeed, explain where he got it; but would his
      explanation be believed? Under present circumstances, he feared that it
      would not. So it was with a sinking heart that he drew out the contents of
      his pockets, and among them his own pocketbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that yours?" asked Mr. Godfrey, turning to Mr. Walton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is not; but he may have transferred my money to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this hint, Mr. Godfrey opened the pocketbook, and drew out the small
      roll of bills, which he proceeded to count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-six dollars," he said. "How much did you lose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Between twenty and thirty dollars. I cannot be sure how much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here are two tens and three twos."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had two tens. I don't remember the denomination of the other bills."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Tom was struck with astonishment at this discovery. He knew that his
      charge was groundless, yet here it was substantiated in a very remarkable
      manner. Was it possible that he had, after all, struck upon the truth of
      the matter? He did not know what to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Herbert," said his employer, sorrowfully, "this discovery gives me more
      pain than I can express. I had a very high idea of you. I could not have
      believed you capable of so mean a thing as deliberate dishonesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not guilty," said Herbert, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you say this in the face of all this evidence? Do you mean to say
      that this money is yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," said Herbert, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where could you have got it?" said his employer, incredulously. "Did you
      not tell me when you entered my employ that you were almost penniless? You
      have been with me three weeks only, and half your wages have been paid for
      board."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; you are right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What explanation, then, can you offer? Your case looks bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The six dollars I saved from my wages, at the rate of two dollars a week.
      The twenty dollars is a part of the money I was robbed of. I succeeded in
      recovering forty dollars of it yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, Herbert related the circumstances already known to the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A likely story," said Tom, scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be silent, Thomas," said Mr. Godfrey. "Your story does not seem
      probable," he proceeded, speaking to Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true, sir," said our hero, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could he have done with your wallet, however?" said the merchant,
      turning to Mr. Walton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has been out to the post office since," said Tom. "He might have
      thrown it away."
    </p>
    <p>
      This unfortunately for Herbert, was true. He had been out, and, of course,
      could have disposed of the wallet in the way mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what to think, Mr. Walton," said Mr. Godfrey. "I'm afraid
      the boy's guilty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid so. I don't care so much for the money, if he will give me
      back the papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't do it, sir," said Herbert, "for I never had them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other boy declares that he saw this one take the wallet from the
      floor, where I probably dropped it. It seems to me that settles the
      matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid it does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once more, Herbert, will you confess?" asked Mr. Godfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can only say, sir, that I am innocent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Walton, what shall we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let the boy go. I will leave it to his honor to return me the papers, and
      he may keep the money. I think he will make up his mind to do so by
      tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear, Herbert," said Mr. Godfrey. "While this matter remains in
      doubt, you cannot retain your situation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mr. Walton, for your indulgence," said Herbert; "but I am
      sorry you think me guilty. The truth will some time appear. I shall TRY to
      do my duty, and TRUST to God to clear me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his hat and left the counting-room with a heavy heart, feeling
      himself in disgrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had great confidence in that boy, Walton," said Mr. Godfrey. "Even now,
      I can hardly believe him guilty."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MR. STANTON IS SURPRISED
    </h3>
    <p>
      While the events recorded in the last chapter were taking place in Mr.
      Godfrey's counting-room another and a different scene took place at the
      office of Mr. Stanton.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just finished reading the morning paper, and, as it slipped from
      his hand, his thoughts turned, transiently, to the nephew whose persistent
      failure to claim relationship puzzled him not a little. He was glad not to
      be called upon for money, of course; still, he felt a little annoyed at
      Herbert's reticence, especially as it left him unable to decide whether
      our hero knew of the tie which connected them. It was scarcely possible to
      suppose that he did not. But in that case, why did he not make some sign?
      The truth did suggest itself to Mr. Stanton's mind that the boy resented
      his cold and indifferent letter, and this thought made him feel a little
      uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was thinking over this subject, one of his clerks entered the
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A gentleman to see you, Mr. Stanton," he said, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanton raised his head, and his glance rested on a tall, vigorous man
      of perhaps thirty-five years of age, who closely followed the clerk. The
      stranger's face was brown from exposure, and there was a certain
      appearance of unconventionality about his movements which seemed to
      indicate that he was not a dweller in cities or a frequenter of
      drawing-rooms, but accustomed to make his home in the wilder haunts of
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In brief, for there is no occasion for mystery, Mr. Stanton's visitor was
      Ralph the Ranger, who had assisted Herbert from the clutches of Abner
      Holden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanton gazed at the stranger with some curiosity, but was unable to
      recognize him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any business with me?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the visitor, in a voice whose depth carried with it an
      assurance of strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "State it, then, as briefly as possible," said the merchant, with a little
      asperity, for there was not as much deference in the manner of the other
      as he thought there should have been. Like most new men, he was jealous of
      his position, and solicitous lest he should not be treated with due
      respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do so," said the stranger, "but as it cannot be summed up in a
      sentence, I will take the liberty of seating myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he sat down in an office chair, which was placed not far from
      that in which Mr. Stanton was sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My time is valuable," said the merchant, coldly. "I cannot listen to a
      long story."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the visitor was plainly, if not roughly, dressed, he suspected that he
      desired pecuniary assistance on some pretext or other, and that his story
      was one of misfortune, intended to appeal to his sympathies. Had such been
      the case, there was very little prospect of help from Mr. Stanton, and
      that gentleman already enjoyed in anticipation the pleasure of refusing
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know me?" demanded Ralph, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanton did not anticipate such a commencement. It had never occurred
      to him to suppose that his rough visitor was one whom he had ever before
      met.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said, "I never saw you before."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph smiled a little bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I have passed entirely out of your remembrance, have I?" he said.
      "Well, it is twelve years since we met."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twelve years," repeated Mr. Stanton. He scanned the stranger's face with
      curiosity, but not a glimmer of recollection came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say I met many persons at that distance of time, whom I cannot
      remember in the least now, even by name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you will remember my name," said Ralph, quietly. "Your memory of
      Ralph Pendleton cannot be wholly obliterated."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanton started, and it was evident from the expression of his face
      that the memory was not a welcome one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you Ralph Pendleton?" he asked, in an undecided voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but not the Ralph Pendleton you once knew. Then I was an
      inexperienced boy; now I am a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you have changed considerably," said Mr. Stanton, uncomfortably,
      "Where have you kept yourself all these years? Why have you not made
      yourself known before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before I answer these questions, I must refer to some circumstances well
      known to both of us. I hope I shall not be tiresome; I will, at least, be
      brief. You were my father's friend. At least, he so considered you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he died, as I had not yet attained my majority, he left you my
      guardian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was in rather an idle frame, and being possessed, as I supposed, of
      fifty thousand dollars, I felt no necessity impelling me to work. You gave
      me no advice, but rather encouraged me in my idle propensities. When I was
      of age, I took a fancy to travel, and left my property in your hands, with
      full power to manage it for me. This trust you accepted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, this is an old story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An old one, but it shall not be a long one. My income being sufficient to
      defray my expenses abroad, I traveled leisurely, with no thought for the
      future. In your integrity I had the utmost confidence. Imagine, then, my
      dismay when, while resident in Paris, I received a letter from you stating
      that, owing to a series of unlucky investments, nearly all my money had
      been sunk, and in place of fifty thousand dollars, my property was reduced
      to a few hundreds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was unlucky, I admit," said Mr. Stanton, moving uneasily in his chair.
      "My investments were unlucky, as it turned out, but the best and most
      judicious cannot always foresee how an investment will turn out. Besides,
      I lost largely, myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you wrote me," said Ralph, quietly. "However, that did not make it any
      the easier for me to bear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not, but it shows, at any rate, that I took the same risk for my
      own money that I did for others."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph proceeded without noticing this remark. "What made matters worse for
      me was that I had fallen in love with a young American lady who, with her
      parents, was then traveling in Europe. My circumstances, as I supposed
      them to be, justified me in proposing marriage. I was accepted by the
      young lady, and my choice was approved by the parents. When, however, I
      learned of my loss of fortune, I at once made it known, and that approval
      was withdrawn. The father told me that, under the altered circumstances,
      the engagement must be considered broken. Still, he held out the prospect
      that, should I ever again obtain a property as large as that I had lost, I
      might marry his daughter. She, on her part, promised to wait for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came to New York, received from you the remnant of my lost fortune, and
      sailed the next week for California, then just open to American
      enterprise. The most glowing stories were told of fortunes won in an
      incredibly short time, Having no regular occupation, and having a strong
      motive for acquiring money, it is not surprising that I should have been
      dazzled with the rest, and persuaded to make the journey to the land of
      gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Quixotic scheme, as I thought at the time," said Mr. Stanton, coldly.
      "For one that succeeded, there were fifty who failed. You had better have
      taken the clerkship I offered you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are wrong," said Ralph, composedly. "There were many who were
      disappointed, but I was not among the number."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you succeed?" asked Mr. Stanton, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So well," answered the other, "that at the end of two years' residence, I
      found myself as rich as I had ever been."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had you made fifty thousand dollars?" demanded the merchant, in
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do? Why did you not let me know of your success?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I once more found myself possessed of a fortune, I took the next
      vessel home with my money. I had but one thought, and that was to claim
      the hand of my promised bride, who had promised to wait for me ten years,
      if necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I found her married," said Ralph, bitterly. "She had forgotten her
      promise, or had been over-persuaded by her parents&mdash;I do not know
      which&mdash;and had proved false to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was unfortunate. But do you still possess the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! I congratulate you," said Mr. Stanton, with suavity, and he held
      out his hand, which Ralph did not appear to see. Ralph Pendleton rich was
      a very different person from Ralph Pendleton poor, and it occurred to him
      that he might so far ingratiate himself into the favor of his former ward
      as to obtain the charge of his second fortune. He saw that it would be
      safe, as well as politic, to exchange his coldness for a warm and cordial
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proceed with your story," he said; "I am quite interested in it."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      RISEN FROM THE DEAD
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ralph Pendleton proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This blow overwhelmed me. All that I had been laboring for seemed
      suddenly snatched from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had your money," suggested Mr. Stanton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I had my money; but for money itself I cared little."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanton shrugged his shoulders a little contemptuously. He could not
      understand how anyone could think slightingly of money, and he decided in
      his own mind that Ralph was an unpractical enthusiast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I valued money only as a means to an end, and that end was to make
      Margaret Lindsay my wife. She failed me, and my money lost its charm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were plenty who could have consoled you in her place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt, I might have been successful in other quarters, but I did not
      care to try. I left New York in disgust, and, going West, I buried myself
      in the forest, where I built a rude cabin, and there I have lived since,
      an unsocial, solitary life. Years have passed since I visited New York."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do with your money all this while?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I left it in the hands of men whom I could trust. It has been
      accumulating all these years, and I find that the fifty thousand dollars
      have swelled to ninety thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" ejaculated Mr. Stanton, his respect for Ralph considerably
      raised. "And now you have come here to enjoy it, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A different motive has led to my coming&mdash;a motive connected with
      you," said Ralph, fixing his eyes steadily upon Mr. Stanton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Connected with me!" repeated the merchant, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask in what manner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expected the question, and am come to answer it. When I returned from
      Europe impoverished, you gave me a brief statement of the manner in which
      you had invested my fortune, and showed me how it had melted away like
      snow before the sun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remember rightly. I bought, on your account, shares in Lake Superior
      Mining Company, which promised excellently, and bade fair to make handsome
      returns. But it proved to be under the management of knaves, and ran
      quickly down from par to two per cent., at which price I thought best to
      sell out, considering that a little saved from the wreck was better than
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is according to the statement you made me," said Ralph, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure," said Mr. Stanton, "that no one regretted more than I do the
      disastrous result. Indeed, I had reason to do so, for I was myself
      involved, and suffered considerable loss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware now that you were concerned in the matter," said Ralph,
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" asked Mr. Stanton, quickly, detecting something
      peculiar in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you. You were right in denouncing the management as knavish.
      The company was got up by knaves, on a basis of fraud, and was from the
      first intended as a trap for the unwary. But there is one important
      circumstance which you have neglected to mention."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?" asked Mr. Stanton, in a voice which strove to be composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean this," said Ralph, firmly, "that you yourself were the prime
      originator of the company&mdash;that you engineered it through to the end&mdash;that
      you invested my money with the express intention of converting it to your
      own profit. I charge you with this, that all, or nearly all the property I
      lost, went into your pocket."
    </p>
    <p>
      The color came and went in Mr. Stanton's face. He seemed staggered by this
      sudden and unexpected accusation, and did not at first make reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling forced to speak at last, he said: "This is very strange language,
      Mr. Pendleton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is unexpected, no doubt, for after all these years you probably
      thought it would remain forever unknown; but in what respect is it
      strange? I have given you a statement of facts as directly as I could."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are not facts. Your charge is wholly false," said the merchant, but
      his tone was not that of a man who speaks the truth boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could believe it," said Ralph. "I wish I could believe that I
      was not deliberately swindled by one who professed to be my father's
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what authority do you bring this monstrous charge?" demanded Mr.
      Stanton, more boldly. "How happens it that you have not made it before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the simple reason that I myself did not suspect any fraud. I presumed
      that it was as you stated to me, and that your only fault was your
      injudicious investment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I admit that, as it turned out, the investment was injudicious.
      Everything else I deny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your denial is vain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot prove the truth of what you say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you fall back on that? But you are mistaken. I can prove the truth of
      what I say," said Ralph firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember a man named David Marston?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is dead," said Mr. Stanton, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you have supposed," said Ralph; "but you were deceived. He is not
      dead. I only encountered him a week since, quite by accident, in my
      Western home. He was your confidential clerk, you remember, and fully
      acquainted with all your business transactions at the time of which I am
      speaking. From him I learned how basely I had been deceived, and with what
      deliberate cruelty you conspired to rob the son of your dead friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe David Marston is alive," said Mr. Stanton, hoarsely, with
      a certain terror in his face. "Indeed, I have proof that he is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know the character of your proof. A paper was forwarded to you from
      Australia, whither you had sent him, containing the record of his death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes? What have you to say against this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That the publication was a mistake. He was dangerously sick, and it was
      falsely announced that he was dead. That notice was sent to you, and you
      believed it to be true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe it now," said Mr. Stanton, doggedly. "Why should I not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you wish to be convinced, proof is at hand. Wait a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph Pendleton rose from his seat and left the counting-room. Two minutes
      had not passed when he returned with an elderly man, thin of face and
      wasted in figure, looking twenty years older than Mr. Stanton, though
      really of about the same age.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is David Marston," said Ralph&mdash;"the living proof that I have
      told you the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanton gazed at him wildly, for to him it was as the face of one
      risen from the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do, Mr. Stanton?" said David Marston, humbly. "It is many,
      many years since we met, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you really David Marston?" demanded Mr. Stanton, never taking his
      eyes off the shrunken figure of his old clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am, sir; greatly changed indeed, but still the David Marston who was
      formerly in your employ. Time hasn't treated me as well as it has you,
      sir. I've been unlucky, and aged fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid your mind is also affected. You have been telling strange
      stories to Mr. Pendleton here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True stories, sir," said David, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, how much is he going to give you for this evidence of yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop, Mr. Stanton! You insult us both," said Ralph Pendleton, sternly. "I
      am not the man to buy false evidence, nor is David Marston the man to
      perjure himself for pay. David, I want you, in Mr. Stanton's presence, to
      make a clear statement of his connection with the mining company by which
      I lost my fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      David Marston obeyed, and in a few words as possible unfolded the story.
      It is not necessary to repeat it here. Enough that it fully substantiated
      the charge which Ralph had brought against his early guardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished, Ralph said, "You can judge what weight Marston's
      testimony would have before a court of justice, and whether it would help
      your commercial standing to have his story made public."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it you want of me?" said Mr. Stanton, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want restitution, dollar for dollar, of my lost money. I will waive
      interest, though I might justly claim it. But, were it all paid, interest
      and principal, the wrong would not be redressed. You cannot restore the
      bride who would have been mine but for your villainy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much time will you give me to pay this money?" asked the merchant,
      moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a short time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must suffice. Do you agree?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bind yourself to that, and for ten days I leave you free."
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfactory security was given that the engagement would be met, and
      Ralph Pendleton left the counting-room. But his countenance was scarcely
      more cheerful than that of the man he had conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am rich," he said to himself; "but of what avail is it? Whom can I
      benefit with my wealth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This thought had scarcely crossed his mind when he came face to face with
      Herbert, walking with a sad and downcast face in the opposite direction.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A FRIEND IN NEED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Herbert left Mr. Godfrey's counting-room very much depressed in spirits.
      But an hour before he had rejoiced in his excellent prospects, and,
      depending on the favor of his employer and his own fidelity, had looked
      forward to a bright future. Now all was changed. He was dismissed from his
      situation in disgrace, suspected of a mean theft. He had, to be sure, the
      consciousness of innocence, and that was a great deal. He was not weighed
      down by the feeling of guilt, at least. Still his prospects were dark.
      Suppose the matter should not be cleared up, and he should still remain
      under suspicion? How could he hope to obtain another place without a
      recommendation from his late employer? No; he must resign all hope of a
      position and adopt some street occupation, such as selling papers or
      vending small articles in a basket, as he had seen boys of his own age
      doing. He did not doubt but that in some way he could get a living, but
      still he would be under suspicion, and that was hard to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these things were passing through his mind he walked down Broadway,
      with his eyes fixed upon the sidewalk. All at once he started to hear his
      name called, and, looking up, to his unbounded astonishment he saw before
      him Ralph the Ranger, whom he had supposed a thousand miles away in his
      cabin in the Ohio woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of a friendly face was most welcome to him at such a time, and
      Ralph's face was friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ralph!" he exclaimed, seizing the Ranger's hand. "How did you come here?
      When did you arrive? You are the last person I expected to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are the one I most wanted to see," said Ralph, his tone
      unconsciously softened by his friendly interest in the boy before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can say the same, Ralph," said Herbert, soberly, "for I am in trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In trouble, boy? I am sorry for that. Is it money? I can get you out of
      that trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not that exactly, Ralph. If you will come into the City Hall Park
      and sit down on a bench with me I will tell you all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Instead of that, let us go into the Astor House," said Ralph. "It is
      where I am stopping."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are stopping at the Astor House?" said Herbert, in momentary
      surprise. "Perhaps you do not know that there are cheaper hotels. Shall I
      direct you to one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Herbert, I am not poor, as you perhaps think. I suppose I should be
      called rich; but that I can explain afterwards. For the present your
      affairs require attention. Come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went up the steps of the Astor House, and Ralph led the way to his
      room, an apartment of good size and handsomely furnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Herbert, take a chair and tell me all," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      To repeat Herbert's story here is unnecessary. Ralph listened with
      attention, and when it was concluded he said: "The main thing is to
      account for the money in your possession. Do you think you should remember
      the policeman who aided you in recovering your money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure I should."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he know how much money you recovered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, for he saw me count the bills."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we must seek him out and induce him to go with us to Mr. Godfrey's
      counting-room and give his testimony."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never thought of that," said Herbert, his face brightening. "When shall
      we go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now. I have nothing else to occupy me, and the sooner you are righted the
      better."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out together, and made their way at once to the spot where
      Herbert had encountered Greenleaf. They had to wait but a brief time when
      the policeman came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember me?" asked Herbert, going up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he replied; "you are the boy that overhauled a thief the other day,
      and got back his money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, he remembers," said Herbert, with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend," said Ralph, "when will you be off duty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In half an hour," said the policeman, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In half an hour, then, I want you to go with me to this boys employer and
      repeat your story. The possession of the money has caused him to be
      suspected, and your evidence, confirming his own, will clear him of having
      obtained it improperly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go," said the officer, "and shall be glad to get him out of a
      scrape. It was all fair and above-board, and I'll say so cheerfully."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the half hour the three made their way to Mr. Godfrey's
      place of business and entered together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Godfrey marked their entrance with surprise, and looked inquiringly at
      Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Godfrey," said Herbert, respectfully, "I have come to prove to you
      that the money I have in my pocketbook is my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be very glad if you can do so," said Mr. Godfrey; and it was
      evident from his manner that he spoke sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This officer knows all the circumstances, and will tell you what he
      knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman made his statement, partly in answer to questions from Mr.
      Godfrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The explanation is satisfactory," said Mr. Godfrey, "and convinces me. It
      does not, however, absolutely clear you, since between the time of the
      money being lost and your being searched you went out to the post office,
      and you might have disposed of the pocketbook and its contents on the
      way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert's countenance fell, but Mr. Godfrey hastened to add. "Although
      your vindication is not complete, I will say that I believe you fully, and
      will receive you back into my employ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have forgotten one thing, sir," said Herbert. "Thomas declares that
      he saw me pick up the wallet and put it in my pocket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I did," said Tom, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Godfrey looked perplexed, and was hesitating what to say when Mr.
      Walton, the owner of the lost pocketbook, hurriedly entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Godfrey," he said, "I have to beg your pardon, and, most of all, the
      pardon of this boy," indicating Herbert. "I have found my pocketbook. I
      didn't lose it here, but my pocket was picked in the street. The
      pickpocket was arrested, and the wallet has been returned to me. This boy
      is innocent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very glad to hear it," said Mr. Godfrey, with emphasis. "Herbert, I
      will try to make amends to you for my transient suspicions of your
      honesty. As for you," he continued, turning to Thomas and speaking
      sternly, "I despise you for your mean attempt to injure your fellow-clerk.
      You must leave my employment to-day. I shall write to your father the
      reasons for dismissing you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can get along without your paltry four dollars a week," said Tom, with
      bravado. "I am not a beggar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be something worse, if you do not amend," said Mr. Godfrey." Mr.
      Pratt, you may pay him for the entire week, and he can go at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Tom professed so much disdain for the four dollars a week, he did
      not decline the week's pay directed to be paid to him, but placed the
      money in his vest pocket and went out with assumed nonchalance, though, in
      reality, deeply mortified at the unexpected discovery of his meanness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for you, Herbert," said Mr. Godfrey, "you can come back at once, and I
      will raise your pay to eight dollars a week. I owe you some reparation for
      the injury you came so near suffering. I will never again doubt your
      integrity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir," said Herbert; "I shall be glad to come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before this matter is decided," said Ralph, "I have a proposition to make
      to Herbert. I am rich, and have no one to share or inherit my wealth. I
      propose to adopt him&mdash;to give him an opportunity to complete his
      education in Europe, whither I propose going, and if some years hence you
      shall be willing to receive him, he can then enter your counting-room to
      learn business. The amount of compensation will be unimportant, as I shall
      provide for him amply."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert stared at Ralph in amazement. He could hardly realize that the
      offer was indeed a genuine one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that I am to go to Europe with you, Ralph?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall like it VERY MUCH," said Herbert, enthusiastically. "How can I
      thank you for so much generous kindness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your companionship will cheer me, and give me something to live for,
      Herbert," said Ralph. "Through you I hope some day to enjoy life again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert's clasped the Ranger's hand in impulsive gratitude, while his face
      beamed with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I congratulate you, Herbert," said Mr. Godfrey, kindly, "though I am
      sorry to lose you. Whenever your guardian is ready to have you enter on a
      business career, a place in my counting-room shall be open to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ralph," said Herbert, seriously, as they went from the counting-room in
      company, "all that has happened seems so wonderful that I am a little
      afraid I shall wake up to find it all a dream."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a change to me also," said Ralph, "to have a new interest in life.
      The past is a sealed book. Let us look forward to a bright and pleasant
      future. Whatever pleasures and advantages money can obtain for you shall
      be yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Herbert, gratefully.

    <h2>
      CONCLUSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Where are you boarding, Herbert?" asked Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Stanton Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall wish you at once to remove to the Astor House, in order that we
      may be together until we sail for Europe."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this pleasant arrangement Herbert made no opposition. He found it a
      great change from the dirty and slipshod boarding-house to the elegant
      arrangements of a first-class hotel. It is needless to say that he enjoyed
      that change not a little. He often had the feeling, of which he had spoken
      to Ralph, that it was a dream from which he would some time awake. But the
      dream was destined to be a pretty long one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a week, much against his will, Mr. Stanton paid over to Ralph
      Pendleton the fifty thousand dollars of which he had years ago defrauded
      him, and thus the Ranger found himself master of a fortune of nearly one
      hundred and fifty thousand dollars. He settled without delay a comfortable
      annuity on David Marston, the old clerk, through whose evidence he had
      been able to ferret out the treachery of Mr. Stanton. Marston needed it,
      for his health was broken down and he was an invalid, prematurely old. He
      is now settled in a comfortable boarding-house in Clinton Street, and
      usually spends his mornings at the Mercantile Library Reading-Room, in
      Astor Place, reading the morning papers. Sometimes he ventures downtown,
      and takes a slow walk through the streets, crowded with busy, bustling
      men, and recalls the years when he, too, was one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before sailing for Europe, Herbert expressed a desire to repay his uncle
      the sum of ten dollars, which the latter had sent to him. Ralph was
      surprised when he learned that this uncle, of whom Herbert spoke, was the
      same man who had been his former guardian. He approved our hero's
      determination, and one morning Herbert entered for the first time his
      uncle's place of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Mr. Stanton in?" he asked of a clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk, in reply, pointed to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      His uncle looked up, but although he had seen our hero at a concert at the
      Academy of Music, he did not recognize him in the new and fashionable suit
      which Ralph had purchased for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Stanton, I suppose?" said Herbert, with quiet self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Do you wish to speak with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must introduce myself," said Herbert. "I am Herbert Mason, your
      nephew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said Mr. Stanton, surprised. "When did you come to the city?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some weeks since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What brought you here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had my living to make. I preferred to make it in the city."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The city is crowded. You had better have remained in the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think so," said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could have got a place on a farm, and in time perhaps might have
      bought a little land for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did get a place on a farm," he said; "but I did not like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing in the city? Have you got a place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I supposed," said his uncle, frowning. "I told you the city was
      overcrowded. You should not have come here. I suppose you relied on me to
      help you to something. But I have my own family to take care of, and my
      first duty is to them, as you must be aware."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think you quite understand my object in calling," said Herbert,
      quietly. "I have not come for assistance of any kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" returned Mr. Stanton, appearing to be puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sent me ten dollars in a letter to Dr. Kent some months since?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I felt that it was best for you to depend on yourself, and that more
      would only encourage you to idleness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come to thank you for the LOAN," said Herbert, emphasizing the
      last word, "and to return the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" exclaimed Mr. Stanton, now thoroughly amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert repeated his former words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't understand this. You are out of a place; yet you do not need
      this money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I do not need it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was certainly astonishing, and Mr. Stanton gazed at his nephew as if
      he did not know what to make of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are your plans?" he asked. "What are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sail for Europe next week," said Herbert, enjoying his uncle's
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sail for Europe!" ejaculated Mr. Stanton, scarcely believing his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am to go to school there, and shall probably remain three or four
      years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are trifling with me," said his uncle, irritably. "How can you go to
      Europe without money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert felt that the time had come for an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A friend," he said, "kindly undertakes to pay all my expenses. I go with
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is your friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Ralph Pendleton. I believe you know him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ralph Pendleton!" repeated Mr. Stanton, in renewed surprise. "How did you
      become acquainted with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The farmer with whom I was placed in Ohio ill-treated me. Ralph lived
      near by, and helped me to run away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanton made no comment. Indeed, his surprise was such that he knew
      not what to say. His friendless and penniless nephew, as he had regarded
      him, was about to share advantages which he would gladly have obtained for
      his own son. When, that evening, at home, he told his family of Herbert's
      good fortune, Tom was filled with bitter envy. If it had been any other
      boy he would have cared less, but for "that begger Herbert" to go to
      Europe in charge of a man of wealth was very mortifying to his pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stanton made a faint protest against receiving the ten dollars
      tendered by his nephew, but Herbert was determined to repay it. He placed
      it on the desk and eventually Mr. Stanton placed it in his pocketbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some reflection, finding his nephew very differently situated from
      what he had supposed, Mr. Stanton, with the concurrence of his wife, whose
      opinion also had been changed, sent an invitation to Ralph and Herbert to
      dine with them previous to their sailing for Europe. Herbert, by his new
      guardian's direction, returned a polite reply, to the effect that they
      were too busy in making preparations for their departure to accept the
      invitation. Ralph did not feel like sitting as the guest of a man who had
      cruelly defrauded him, and had only done him justice when he was actually
      compelled to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time our hero sailed for Europe with Mr. Ralph Pendleton. They
      divided their time between Paris and Berlin, Herbert studying at both
      places. With his natural good abilities, he made rapid progress, and at
      the end of four years was an accomplished scholar, able to speak both
      French and German with facility. In watching his progress, Ralph Pendleton
      found a new and fresh interest in life. He recovered from his old, morbid
      feeling, and became cheerful and happy. On returning to New York, Herbert,
      who felt that he should enjoy a life of business better than a
      professional career, entered the counting-room of Mr. Godfrey. At
      twenty-one, the junior partner retiring, he was received as partner in his
      place, his guardian, Ralph Pendleton, purchasing an interest for him at a
      cost of fifty thousand dollars. He developed good business abilities, and
      bid fair to swell this sum, in time, to a large fortune. There is a
      prospect that he will, in time, sustain a closer relation to his senior
      partner, as it is rumored that Julia Godfrey, now a brilliant young belle,
      prefers her father's young partner to any of the crowd of young men who
      pay her court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other characters in our story demand a few closing words. First, for
      Mr. Stanton. It might have been the sudden withdrawal of the fifty
      thousand dollars from his business that embarrassed him. At any rate, from
      that time nothing prospered with him. He met with loss after loss, until,
      in a time of financial panic he failed. He saved but a little from the
      wreck of his fortune, That little started him in a modest business,
      yielding him, perhaps, one-tenth his former income. The brownstone house
      was sold. He moved into a shabby house in an obscure street, where Mrs.
      Stanton spends her time mostly in bewailing the loss of her former
      splendor.

    <p>
      Tom developed habits of extravagance, and seemed indisposed to work
      steadily. Finally, when his reverses came, his father was compelled to
      refuse further assistance, and now Tom, in an inferior clerkship, on a
      small salary, gazes with envy at his once-despised cousin, with whom he
      has completely changed places. How he will come out eventually is
      doubtful. Unless he changes considerably, it is not likely that his
      circumstances will ever be much better than at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abner Holden died suddenly last year in a fit of delirium tremens. His
      habits of intemperance grew upon him until they led to this sad result.
      His death did not excite any very prolonged grief in the community, as his
      temper and uncertain honesty had made him very far from popular. To the
      housekeeper who had been kind to him, Herbert sent a valuable silk dress,
      of the richest fabric, of which Mrs. Bickford is very proud. She only
      wears it on great occasions, and then is particular to mention that it was
      presented to her by Herbert Mason, of the great New York firm of Godfrey
      &amp; Mason, who was once Abner Holden's bound boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Herbert forgetful of his good friends, the Kents. He paid off the
      mortgage on the doctor's place, and insisted on putting the house in
      thorough repair, and newly furnishing it, so that now the town of Waverley
      does not contain a handsomer house, inside and out, than that of Dr. Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we bid farewell to our young hero, fairly launched on a prosperous
      career, trusting that his life-path may be bright to the end, and that he
      may leave behind him, at the end of his career, the reputation of a noble
      and honorable merchant, and a life filled with good deeds.
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
